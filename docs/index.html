<h1 id="preface.">PREFACE.</h1>
<p>THE object of this little book is to help those who are beginning
Greek to learn from the first to write the language as well as read it.
There is among many teachers a strong belief (which I am inclined to
share) that Greek is mastered much more effectively if a little writing
be combined with the reading, even from the earliest stages. The great
inferiority of the knowledge of Greek acquired at schools, as compared
with Latin, is partly, no doubt, due to the language being harder and
begun later, but partly also to the fact that Latin writing is
cultivated from the first, while Greek writing is so commonly
neglected.</p>
<p>The difficulties of Greek composition fall naturally into three
heads, —difficulties of Accidence, of Syntax, and of Idiom. Speaking
broadly, this book is meant to deal chiefly with the first, and so may
serve as a first stage (for those who mean to pursue the study) to my
Introduction to Greek Prose Composition! which deals with the other two
sets of difficulties included under the head of Syntax and Idiom.</p>
<p>In reality, of course, it is neither possible nor desirable that this
distinction should be rigidly maintained, as there are questions both of
Syntax and Idiom which will-occur in the most elementary composition.
Thus, if we take the sentence, ‘I used that horse which I had bought,’
while it would be difficult to find a more simple one, still it
undoubtedly involves two points of Syntax—that χρῶμαι, ‘I use,’ requires
the Dative case, and that ἐκεῖνος, ’ that,’ requires the Article——and
two points of Idiom—that the Relative is attracted (not ὅν, but ᾧ) to
the case of the antecedent, and that the Greeks would probably say, not
‘had bought,’ but ‘bought,’ so that the whole sentence would be
ἐχρησάμην ἐκείνῳ τῷ ἵππῳ, ᾧ ἐπριάμην. Points such as these, which one
may call the elements of Syntax and Idiom, will be found treated here
with tolerable completeness. Thus the student will learn the use of the
Tenses, the use of the Cases, the use of Participles, the use of the
Genitive Absolute, all of which belong to the simple sentence, and are
really quite easily grasped at an early stage, And I have introduced
also from time to time the easier and commoner forms of even the
Compound Sentence; the Accusative and Infinitive (familiar from Latin),
the use of πρὶν and ὥστε with the Infinitive, the easy rules about ἵνα,
and the two simplest cases of ἄν. In this way I have endeavoured to lead
the student to the point at which he may take to more advanced books of
Greek prose composition, or, if the teacher prefers, may do pieces
selected from English narratives.</p>
<p>I have further endeavoured to make the book progressive from the
beginning. The first few Exercises require no knowledge, except of the A
Declension. After that we advance to the other Declensions, then to the
easier Tenses of the Verbs, then the harder Tenses, etc. The same
progressive character I have kept, or tried to keep, in introducing the
usages; thus the Participial usages begin in Exercise 35, the Genitive
Absolute in 50, Construction of ‘Knowing’ Verbs in 73, ‘Final’ Clauses
in 79, and so on.</p>
<p>The same plan has been adhered to which was adopted in my Greek Prose
Composition, of giving all the Exercises in a narrative form. This plan,
which is intended to diminish the dulness of doing English into Greek,
is even more desirable at the early stages of composition than at the
later, inasmuch as the boys are younger, and the Accidence must in any
case be great drudgery. It is not at all necessary that anything of
value should be sacrificed in adopting this plan, if proper care be
taken. The main difficulty, of course, was in the first Exercises, where
only a few Substantives and Adjectives are supposed to be known; but
this was got over by writing out the three tenses of the verb ‘to be,’
and, whenever any other verbs were used, giving the part required. Thus
from the first the Exercises are more or less connected wholes, and the
plan of familiarising the learner with certain common forms of the Verb
before he comes to learn them, seemed not only unobjectionable but
advantageous.</p>
<p>I have given all the new words used in each Exercise in a Vocabulary
at the head of it, and αἰ the words of all the Exercises in the
collected Vocabulary at the end. Thus, if the learner remembers the
words he had already had, he will want no help but his Accidence and the
page before him; if he forgets them, he will simply have to turn to the
Vocabulary at the end. In the Vocabularies I have given the stems of the
Substantives, and the Genders where doubtful, and, after the Exercises,
a list of the Irregular Verbs used in them.</p>
<p>I will only add that I shall be most grateful if those who use the
book will kindly point out any errors or omissions which they may
detect.</p>

<h1 id="first-greek-writer">FIRST GREEK WRITER</h1>
<h1 id="the-article.">THE ARTICLE.</h1>
<p><strong>§ 1.</strong> The Article <em>ὀ ἡ τό</em> gives a good deal
of trouble to the learner before its use is fully mastered, and it is
best therefore to explain the main points about it at the very
first.</p>
<p>There is no word in Greek for <em>a, an</em>: it is simply omitted:
or the Indefinite Pronoun <em>τις</em>, ‘a certain one,’ is used. The
Greek Article means <em>the</em>, and it is used (broadly speaking)
wherever we use <em>the</em>, but also in some places where we do not.
It is these latter which constitute the difficulty to the beginner.</p>
<h2 id="position-of-the-article-with-adjectives.">§ 2. Position of the
Article with Adjectives.</h2>
<p>In English we say ‘the bad man;’ and if we wish to translate this
into Greek, the point to observe is that <em>the adjective must have the
article</em>.</p>
<p>The order of Adjectives and Substantives may be inverted if we
please. Thus we may say either <em>ὁ κακὸς ἀνήρ</em>, or <em>ὁ ἀνὴρ ὁ
κακός</em>; but in either case the Adjective must have the Article.
΄</p>
<p>If this rule is broken, as it is often by beginners, and if we write
<em>ὁ ἀνὴρ κακός</em>, or <em>κακὸς ὁ ἀνήρ</em>, the phrase is still
good Greek, but the meaning is quite altered; it is no longer ‘the bad
man,’ but ‘the man is bad.’ The adjective, by being deprived of the
article, has ceased to be an attribute, and has become a predicate.</p>
<h2 id="the-article-with-adjectives.">§ 3. The Article with
Adjectives.</h2>
<p>The Article is sometimes used in English with only an Adjective, the
Substantive being understood. This is also a Greek idiom, but is a great
deal more frequent than in English, especially in the neuter. Examples
:—</p>
<ul>
<li>The wise [men]. <br/>οἵ σώφρονες.</li>
<li>The bad-tempered person. <br/>ὁ δύσκολος,</li>
<li>The Beautiful [abstract]. <br/>τὸ καλόν.</li>
<li>Troublesome things. <br/>τὰ ἀνιαρά.</li>
<li>Uncertainty. <br/>τὸ ἀστάθμητον.</li>
<li>Other people’s country. <br/>ἡ ἀλλοτρία.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-article-with-adjectives-of-position.">§ 4. The Article with
Adjectives of Position.</h2>
<p>One usage must be carefully observed. When the Article is used with
adjectives of position, the Adjective comes first, outside the Article.
Thus :—</p>
<ul>
<li>On the top of the hill. <br/>ἐπ᾿ ἀκροῦ τοῦ λόφου.</li>
<li>In the middle of the road. <br/>ἐν μέσῃ τῇ ὁδῷ.</li>
</ul>
<p>So with πᾶς, as often in English :—</p>
<ul>
<li>All the men. <br/>πάντες οἱ ἄνθρωποι.</li>
<li>All night long. <br/>πᾶσαν τὴν νύκτα.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-article-with-participles.">§ 5. The Article with
Participles.</h2>
<p>Just as we have seen above in the case of the Adjective, so in
English we can in a few cases use the Article with Participles (whether
the Substantive is expressed or only understood does not matter); such
as the following :—’ The living,’ ‘the dead,’ ‘the defeated cavalry,’
‘the coming man,’ ‘the insufficiently apprehended truth,’ etc. In Greek
there is no limit to this use. The following are a few examples :—.</p>
<ul>
<li>The cause of what occurred. <br/>ἡ αἰτία τοῦ γενομένον.</li>
<li>The events which have happened. <br/>τὰ γεγενημένα.</li>
<li>The survivors. <br/>οἱ περιγενόμενοι.</li>
<li>Expediency, duty, etc. <br/>τὸ συμφέρον, τὸ δέον, etc.</li>
<li>The thing asked for. <br/>τὸ αἰτούμενον.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so with longer phrases :—</p>
<ul>
<li>The men who took: their share in this perilous undertaking. οἱ τοῦδε
τοῦ κινδύνου ξυναράμενοι ἄνδρες.</li>
<li>All the actions done by me for the good of the city πάντα τὰ ἐμοὶ
ἐπ᾽ ἀγαθῷ τῆς πόλεως πεπραγμένα.</li>
</ul>
<p>Constantly, therefore, when in English we have a relative sentence
with a verb, in Greek we have simply a phrase (coupled to the noun) with
Article and Participle.</p>
<h2 id="the-article-with-adverbial-clauses-etc.">§ 6. The Article with
Adverbial Clauses, etc.</h2>
<p>Another very natural extension of the use of the Article in Greek is
the following :—Instead of saying, as we might by § 5, οἵ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως
ἐλθόντες, ‘the people who had come out of the city,’ since the sense is
quite clear without the Participle, we can often say simply—οἱ ἐκ τῆς
πόλεως, ‘the people from the city.’</p>
<p>So a vast number of convenient phrases :—</p>
<ul>
<li>The bean that was below. <br/>ὁ κύαμος ὁ κάτωθεν.</li>
<li>Those who were there. <br/>οἱ ἐκεῖ,</li>
<li>The things of old. <br/>τὰ πάλαι.</li>
<li>What happened afterwards. <br/>τὰ ἐνθένδε, or τὰ ἔπειτα.</li>
<li>The camp on the mountain. <br/>τὸ στρατόπεδον τὸ ἐπὶ τοῦ ὄρους.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>§ 7.</strong> Observe: it is very important for turning into
Greek to notice whether such a clause as those given above belongs to
the Substantive or not. On this will depend whether we have to put the
Article or not.</p>
<p>Thus, compare the two sentences—</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I killed the stranger from Corinth.</li>
<li>I killed the stranger in the street.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is clear that in (1) ‘from Corinth’ belongs to the ‘stranger;’
while in (2) ‘in the street’ belongs not to ’stranger, but to the verb.
In English, the sense only is our guide, not the structure. In Greek we
know at once what is meant from the use of the Article.</p>
<p>Thus (1) is</p>
<ul>
<li>τὸν ξένον τὸν ἀπὸ Κορίνθου ἔκτεινα,</li>
</ul>
<p>and (2) is</p>
<ul>
<li>τὸν ξένον ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ἔκτεινα.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, in some cases <em>exactly the same phrase</em> may either
require the Article or not, according to circumstances. It depends on
the principle above enunciated, namely, that the adverbial phrase
without the Article belongs to the Verb, with the Article to the
Substantive. Thus :—</p>
<ul>
<li>I conceived a suspicion about him. <br/>ὑποψίαν ἔλαβον περὶ
αὐτοῦ.</li>
<li>I went away from suspicion about him. <br/>ἀπῆλθον ὑποψίᾳ τῇ περὶ
αὐτοῦ.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-article-with-the-infinitive.">§ 8. The Article with the
Infinitive.</h2>
<p>The neuter Article τό is also very conveniently used with the
Infinitive, where we use the gerund-form or verbal substantive in -ing.
Thus :—</p>
<ul>
<li>Singing is difficult. <br/>τὸ ᾄδειν χαλεπόν ἐστι.</li>
<li>Many things are done by trying. <br/>πολλὰ τῷ πειρᾶσθαι
περαίνεται.</li>
<li>Skilled in shooting. <br/>ἔμπειρος τοῦ τοξεύειν.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, if there is a subject to the Verb, the Accusative and Infinitive
is used, as might be expected :—</p>
<ul>
<li>We were beaten owing to our allies running away. <br/>ἐνικήθημεν διὰ
τὸ [τοὺς ξυμμάχους ἀποδρᾶναι].</li>
<li>That the invaders have been worsted is a great gain. <br/>τὸ [τοὺς
ἐςβαλόντας ἡσσῆσθαι] μέγα κέρδος ἐστίν.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-article-with-demonstratives">§ 9. The Article with
Demonstratives:</h2>
<p>Another point about the Article is its use with Demonstratives, which
differs from the English usage, and therefore is important to
observe.</p>
<p>Whenever ‘this’ or ‘that’ comes in English with a Substantive, the
Article must come in the Greek with the Substantive, though the ’ this’
or ‘that’ may be either before after the Substantive.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
Thus :—</p>
<ul>
<li>This word. <br/>οὗτος ὁ λόγος, οr ὁ λόγος οὗτος:</li>
<li>Those enemies. <br/>ἐκεῖνοι οἱ πολέμιοι, or οἱ πολέμιοι
ἐκεῖνοι.</li>
</ul>
<p>The same is true of ὅδε,</p>
<h2 id="the-article-with-substantives.">§ 10. The Article with
Substantives.</h2>
<p>There are even with Substantives some cases where the English use of
the differs from the Greek. Some of these are too subtle to be worth
troubling about at an early stage: they will be learnt after. But some
are quite easy, such as the following cases, where in English the
Article is omitted, but in Greek is inserted —-</p>
<p>(a.) Class names (often).</p>
<ul>
<li>Men are strong: women are weak, <br/>οἱ μὲν ἄνδρες ἰσχυροί, ἀσθενεῖς
δὲ αἱ γυναῖκες.</li>
<li>Greeks are often philosophers. <br/> Ἕλληνες πολλάκις φιλόσοφοί
εἰσι.</li>
<li>Large fish are easily caught. <br/>ῥᾳδίως ἁλίσκονται αἱ μακραὶ
ἰχθύες.</li>
<li>Ears are more beautiful than tails. <br/>τὰ ὦτα καλλίω τῶν
κέρκων.</li>
</ul>
<p>(b.) Abstract.</p>
<ul>
<li>Truth is hard to find. <br/>χαλεπὴ εὑρεῖν ἡ ἀλήθεια.</li>
<li>You are superior in piety. <br/>τῇ εὐσεβείᾳ κρείσσων εἶ.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="neuter-plural.">NEUTER PLURAL.</h1>
<p><strong>§ 11.</strong> In Greek a Neuter Plural Noun requires the
Singular Verb. Thus :—</p>
<ul>
<li>These things are so. <br/>ταῦτα οὕτως ἐστίν.</li>
<li>The trees are tall. <br/>τὰ δένδρα ἐστὶ μακρά.</li>
<li>I will tell you what happened. <br/>λέξω ἅπερ ἐγένετο.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="pronouns.">PRONOUNS.</h1>
<h2 id="the-personal-pronouns.">§ 12. The Personal Pronouns.</h2>
<p>The Personal Pronouns are used just as they are in English, for the
most part: the exceptions being the following :—</p>
<h2 id="often-omitted-with-verbs.">(1.) Often omitted with Verbs.</h2>
<p>Since the Verbs in Greek by their terminations show what person (1st,
2d, or 3d Singular or Plural) is the Nominative to them (just as is the
case in Latin, but mostly not the case in English), it is clear that the
Personal Pronouns in the Nominative may be frequently omitted. In fact
they will only be put in when there is any emphasis upon them, or
otherwise need of them for clearness. Thus :—</p>
<ul>
<li>I went down to the city. <br/>κατέβην εἰς τὴν πόλιν.</li>
<li>He ordered me to stop. <br/>ἐκέλευσέ με μεῖναι.</li>
<li>You think rightly. <br/>καλῶς δοξάζετε.</li>
<li>We will talk to one another. <br/>διαλεξόμεθα ἀλλήλοις.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="inserted-when-emphatic.">§ 13. (2.) Inserted when Emphatic.</h2>
<p>On the other hand, if there is any stress upon the person, the
Pronoun must of course be put in, as—</p>
<ul>
<li>The rest were away, but you were there. <br/>οἱ μὲν ἄλλοι ἀπῆσαν, σὺ
δὲ παρῆσθα.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will naturally be done when in a narrative a new sentence begins
with a new Nominative or subject. Thus :—</p>
<ul>
<li>They came to me and asked me to go with them. But I replied that I
would not consent. <br/>καὶ οἵ μὲν ἦλθον πρὸς ἐμέ, καὶ ᾔτησαν συνέπεσθαι
αὑτοῖς. ἐγὼ δὲ οὐκ ἔφην πείσεσθαι.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-third-personal-pronoun.">§ 14. (3.) The Third Personal
Pronoun.</h2>
<p>The Third Person in Greek requires a little care. The fact is, that
while there is a Greek word for the Genitive, Dative, and Accusative of
the Third Person, there is no proper Greek word for the Nominative (he,
she, it, they) except with the particles μὲν and δὲ, which can only
occur at the beginning of a sentence or clause. This is simply due to
the fact that it is not wanted. Let us consider the various cases where
he (etc.) is used in English.</p>
<p>(a.) Where there is no emphasis or stress on the person, and it is
quite clear who is meant, there is no need in Greek of a Pronoun at all.
See § 12.</p>
<ul>
<li>And having said this, hé died. <br/>καὶ ταῦτα εἰπὼν ἐτελεύτησε.</li>
<li>He collected his army, and went off. <br/>συλλέξας τὸ στράτευμα
ἀπῴχετο.</li>
</ul>
<p>(b.) At the beginning of clauses or new sentences in narrative, where
the Pronouns are required for clearness, ὁ μέν and ὁ δέ can be used. It
should be mentioned that μὲν is not used except with a δὲ clause
corresponding and following after it. Thus :—</p>
<ul>
<li>And they departed, but she stayed. <br/>καὶ οἱ μὲν ἀπῆλθον, ἡ δὲ
ἔμεινεν.</li>
<li>He feasted, but I slept. <br/>ὁ μὲν ὁὖν ἐδείπνει, ἐγὼ δὲ
καθηῦδον.</li>
<li>And when Cinadon was brought up, the Ephors asked him about the
matter. And he replied… <br/>ὡς δὲ ἀνήχθη ὁ Κινάδων, ἤροντο αὐτὸν ot
ἔφοροι περὶ τοῦ πράγματος. ὃ δὲ ἀπεκρίνατο. ..</li>
</ul>
<p>(c.) When the he (etc.) is emphatic, then οὗτος or ἐκεῖνος, the
Demonstratives, are used.</p>
<ul>
<li>He at least will not flee. <br/>οὔποτε ἐκεῖνός ye φεύξεται.</li>
<li>They allowed their enemies to live, and shall we kill them?
<br/>ἐκεῖνοι μεν τοὺς πολεμίους εἴων ζῆν, ἡμεῖς δὲ ἀποκτενοῦμεν;</li>
<li>It is strange if he shall do it. <br/>δεινὸν εἰ οὗτός γε
δράσει.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="oblique-cases.">§ 15. Oblique Cases.</h2>
<p>Thus much about the Nominative of the Third Personal Pronoun. The
Oblique Cases are simple: for whenever a word is required at all (which
is less often than in English), the oblique cases of atrés are used. A
few instinces will suffice :—</p>
<ul>
<li>They killed him. <br/>ἀπέκτειναν αὐτόν.</li>
<li>Ι gave it her. <br/>ἔδωκα αὐτῇ.</li>
<li>I drank it. <br/>ἔπιον, or ἔπιον αὐτό,</li>
<li>He cut off their heads. <br/>ἀπέταμον τὰς κεφαλὰς αὑτῶν.</li>
</ul>
<p>When to use it and when to omit it, the learner can only find out by
practice; but he is certain at first to put it in a great deal too
often, since the Pronoun is commoner in English than in Greek.</p>
<h2 id="αὔτός.">§ 16. αὔτός.</h2>
<p>αὐτός is a puzzling word for the beginner, owing to its various uses,
for ‘self,’ ‘him,’ and ‘the same.’ It is necessary for him to go fully
into the matter, and constantly refer to the explanation and examples,
until he is familiar with them.</p>
<p>(1.) ‘The same’ is always ὁ αὐτός; the Article coming before αὐτός,
Thus :—</p>
<ul>
<li>The same man. <br/>ὁ αὐτὸς ἀνήρ.</li>
<li>Of the same woman. <br/>τῆς αὐτῆς γυναικός.</li>
</ul>
<p>(2.) ‘Self’ (if it is not reflexive) is αὐτός without the Article
before it. Thus :—</p>
<ul>
<li>He himself said it. <br/>αὐτὸς εἶπεν.</li>
<li>These men themselves were killed. <br/>οὗτοι οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοὶ
ἀπέθανον.</li>
<li>At their own request he came. [i.e. themselves asking. ] <br/>αὐτῶν
ἀξιούντων ἦλθεν.</li>
<li>The wall of the city itself. <br/>τὸ τεῖχος αὐτῆς τῆς πόλεως.</li>
<li>He said he himself had done it. <br/>ἔφη αὐτὸς δεδρακέναι.</li>
<li>It is needful for you to go yourself there. <br/>ἀνάγκη σὲ ἐκεῖσε
αὐτὸν ἐλθεῖν (not σεαυτόν).</li>
<li>I must do it myself.ἐμὲ <br/>δεῖ αὐτὸν ποιεῖν (not ἐμαυτόν).</li>
</ul>
<p>(3.) If i is reflexive [1.e. if it refers to the same person as the
subject to the verb, and is in an oblique case, and is not a subject
itself] use ἑαυτοῦ (ἐμαυτοῦ, σεαυτοῦ), or the less formal οὗ, οὗ, ἔ; and
in plural, σφῶν, or σφῶν αὐτῶν, or ἑαυτῶν (ἡμῶν αὐτῶν, ὑμῶν αὐτῶν). Thus
:—</p>
<ul>
<li>He went to his own home. <br/>πρὸς τὸν ἑαυτοῦ οἶκον ἀπῄει.</li>
<li>They replied to themselves. <br/>ἀντεῖπον ἑαυτοῖς, or σφίσιν
αὐτοῖς.</li>
<li>Know thyself. <br/>γνῶθι σεαυτόν.</li>
<li>Ι will kill myself. <br/>ἀποκτενῶ ἐμαυτόν.</li>
<li>We fear lest it be bad for ourselves. <br/>φοβούμεθα μὴ ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς
κακὸν ᾖ.</li>
</ul>
<p>(4.) αὐτός in the oblique cases is also used for the cases of ‘he,’
‘she,’ ‘it,’ ‘they,’ as we have seen above in treating of the Pronouns,
§ 15.</p>
<h2 id="him-reflexive.">§ 17. ‘Him’ Reflexive.</h2>
<p>Note 1.—It should be, however, observed, that in English we do not
always say ‘himself,’ but often simply ‘him’ (‘her,’ ‘it,’ etc.), even
where the Pronoun is really reflexive.</p>
<p>Thus :—</p>
<ul>
<li>They knew he was hostile to them. [them is reflexive = themselves. ]
<br/>ᾔδεσαν αὐτὸν σφίσιν ἐχθρὸν ὄντα.</li>
<li>He said tt was his cloak. [his = of himself. ] <br/>ἔφη ἑαυτοῦ εἶναι
τὸ ἱμάτιον.</li>
<li>He took τὲ away with him. <br/>ἀπέφερε μεθ’ ἑαυτοῦ.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="article-to-express-his.">§ 18. Article to express ’ His.’</h2>
<p>Note 2.—Often again, where in English ‘his,’ etc., is used reflexive,
and where’ we ,might say in Greek ‘of himself,’ ἑαυτοῦ, it is enough, if
no stress is laid on the Pronoun, to use the Article simply. Thus :—</p>
<ul>
<li>He hurt his head. <br/>τὴν κεφάλην ἐτραυμάτισε.</li>
</ul>
<p>See fuller explanation in § 21.</p>
<h2 id="it-in-english.">§ 19. ‘It’ in English.</h2>
<p>The beginner should be cautioned about the use of the English ‘it,’ a
Pronoun which stands for every inanimate Substantive and most animals.
In Greek, on the contrary, the Pronoun has naturally to be of the gender
of the Noun for which it stands.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>He left the gold, for he knew it [χρυσὸς, Masculine] would be
safe. <br/>… τοῦτον ἀσφαλῆ ἐσόμενον.</p></li>
<li><p>The dove approached : he pulled it in [περιστερὰ, Feminine].
<br/>… εἰςήγαγεν αὐτήν.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="possessive.">§ 20. Possessive.</h1>
<p>With the exception treated below, the Possessive Pronouns are used
pretty much as in English. It is only necessary to mention that there is
no Possessive for the third person, and accordingly the Genitive of the
Personal Pronoun is used instead, αὐτοῦ, αὐτῆς, αὐτῶν, or, if reflexive,
ἑαυτοῦ, ἑαυτῆς, ἑαυτῶν. The others are ἐμός (mine), σός (thine),
ὑμέτερος (yours), ἡμέτερος (ours). Thus :—-</p>
<ul>
<li>He took my shield. <br/>τὴν ἐμὴν ἀσπίδα ἔλαβε.</li>
<li>He ts your father. <br/>σὸς πάτηρ ἐστί.</li>
<li>He slew their wives. <br/>τὰς γυναῖκας αὐτῶν ἀπέκτεινε,</li>
<li>They died by their own hand. <br/>τῇ ἑαυτῶν χειρὶ ἀπέθανον.</li>
</ul>
<p>Observe that the Article is used with the Possessives (ἐμός, σός,
etc.), except where the Substantive with the Possessive is a predicate,
i.e. comes after the verb ‘to be.’</p>
<p><strong>§ 21.</strong> Note.—The exception alluded to above is this.
In English the Possessive occurs much oftener than in Greek : it is used
with no emphasis at all, where there could be no doubt (if it were
omitted) whose the thing was. In such a case as that, it is usual in
Greek to employ the Article only.</p>
<p>For example—</p>
<ul>
<li>They took up their arms and retreated,</li>
</ul>
<p>[Here there is no emphasis on ‘their’: if nothing was said as to
whose arms, you would naturally assume they took their own : and
accordingly in Greek it would be more usual to say ‘the arms.’]</p>
<ul>
<li>τὰ ὅπλα λαβόντες ἀπεχώρουν.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other instances are the following, which will not need comment :—</p>
<ul>
<li>Come with your wife. <br/>ἐλθὲ μετὰ τῆς γυναικός.</li>
<li>They defend their country. <br/>τῇ πόλει βοηθοῦσι.</li>
<li>He prospered all his life. <br/>πάντα τὸν βίον εὐτύχει. We shall
finish our task. <br/>τὸ ἔργον περανοῦμεν.</li>
</ul>
<p>Common sense will settle, in more complicated sentences, whether the
Article or the Possessive is best. Thus :—</p>
<ul>
<li>He sent his slave to their house. <br/>ἔπεμψε τὸν δοῦλον πρὸς τὴν
ἐκείνων οἰκίαν.</li>
<li>They sent their slave to thetr house. <br/>ἔπεμψαν τὸν δοῦλον πρὸς
τὴν οἰκίαν.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because in the second the persons concerned are the same all through;
in the first they are changed.</p>
<h2 id="ἄλλος-ἄλλοτε-etc.">§ 22. ἄλλος, ἄλλοτε, etc.</h2>
<p>Two idiomatic uses of ἄλλος and its compounds are to be noticed.</p>
<p>(1.) When two are opposed, corresponding to the English use of some …
others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some were rich, others poor. <br/>ἄλλοι μὲν πλούσιοι ἦσαν, ἄλλοι δὲ
πένητες.</li>
<li>Sometimes I ate: at other times I fasted. <br/>ἄλλοτε μὲν ἤσθιον,
ἄλλοτε δὲ ἐπείνων.</li>
</ul>
<p>(2.) When we wish to use the word in a distributive sense, i.e. when
we describe an indefinite number of divergent acts, courses, qualities,
etc. In English we either repeat the word different, as ‘different
people went different ways,’ or use a complex though accurate form of
sentence, as follows :—’ One person went one way and another another.’
In Greek this is done more neatly by an idiomatic use of ἄλλος.</p>
<ul>
<li>One went one way and another another. <br/>ἄλλοι ἄλλῃ ἀπῆλθον.</li>
<li>Different things are thought beautiful in different places.<br/>ἄλλα
ἀλλαχοῦ καλά.</li>
<li>Different courses pleased different people at different times.
<br/>ἄλλοις ἄλλοτε ἄλλα ἐδόκει.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="οὗτος-and-ὅδε.">§ 23. οὗτος and ὅδε.</h2>
<p>ὅδε is chiefly used in prose for ’ the following :’ otherwise it is
used only by a speaker. Accordingly, when you say ‘this,’ meaning what
is coming, you use in Greek ὅδε (or similar compounds, τοιόςδε, τοσόςδε,
τηλικόςδε) : when you say ‘this,’ meaning what has gone before, you must
employ οὗτος (or similar compounds, τοιοῦτος, τοσοῦτος, etc.). Thus
:—</p>
<ul>
<li>He spoke as follous. <br/>τοιάδε ἔλεξε.</li>
<li>Having thus spoken. <br/>τοιαῦτα λέξας.</li>
<li>On these terms (viz., on such terms as I have said). <br/>ἐπὶ
τούτοις.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="τοιοῦτος.">§ 24. τοιοῦτος.</h2>
<p>τοιοῦτος is often used in Greek where in English another adjective
might occur, especially where the sense of the adjective has been given
before, or where τοσοῦτος is used with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>So many and so soft rugs. <br/>τοσοῦτοι καὶ τοιοῦτοι τάπητες.</li>
<li>The island is barren, it is difficult to live in so unproductive a
land. <br/>ἐρήμη ἡ νῆσος, ὥστε ἐν τοιαύτῃ γῇ οὐ ῥᾴδιον ζῆν.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="relative-and-interrogative.">§ 25. Relative and
Interrogative.</h2>
<p>The learner is puzzled at first often by the English word what, owing
to its being both relative [= ‘that which’], and interrogative [ =
‘what?’ ].</p>
<p>The best rule is to stop and think whether the sentence remains the
same in meaning after substituting ‘that which’ for ‘what.’ If so, a
Relative is required. Otherwise it will be an Interrogative. [Sometimes
either will make sense, and then it clearly does not matter. ]</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Interrogative.
<ul>
<li>I investigated what was going on. <br/>ἐσκόπουν τί γίγνεται.</li>
<li>No one could tell me what was the cause. <br/>οὐδεὶς ἤδει τί εἴη τὸ
αἴτιον.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Relative.
<ul>
<li>He laughed at what I had done. <br/>κατεγέλα ὧν ἔδρασα.</li>
<li>What he did yesterday delights all. <br/>πάντες ἥδονται ἐφ᾽ οἷς
ἐχθὲς ἐποίησεν.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>The relative ‘what’ may also be done with Article and Participle. See
§ 5.</p>
<ul>
<li>The cause of what happens. <br/>τὸ αἴτιον τοῦ γιγνομένου.</li>
<li>The proceeds of what has been sold. <br/>ἡ πρόσοδος τῶν
πεπραμένων.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="attraction.">§ 26. Attraction.</h2>
<p>When the Gender, Case, Mood, etc., of one word of a sentence is
altered from what it would naturally be to suit the Gender, Case, Mood,
etc., of some other word or words, such alteration is said to be due to
attraction.</p>
<p>There are many forms of attraction in Greek, the commonest being the
attraction of the Relative.</p>
<h2 id="relative-attracted.">§ 27. Relative Attracted.</h2>
<p>(1.) When the antecedent is in the Genitive or Dative, and the
Relative would naturally be in Accusative, Attraction often takes place,
i.e. the Relative may be put into the same case as the Antecedent.</p>
<ul>
<li>None of the friends I have. <br/>οὐδεὶς τῶν φίλων ὧν ἔχω (for
οὓς).</li>
<li>I am pleased with the horse I keep. <br/>τῳ ἵππῷ ᾧ τρέφω ἥδομαι (for
ὃν).</li>
</ul>
<p>(2.) This is still more frequent and idiomatic when the Antecedent is
’a mere Pronoun, which can be omitted. See § 25 (2).</p>
<ul>
<li>I abide by what I have sworn. <br/>ἐμμένω οἷς ὤμοσα.</li>
<li>I thank you for what you promised. <br/>χάριν ἔχω σοὶ ὧν
ὑπέσχου.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="attraction-of-the-subject.">§ 28. Attraction of the
Subject.</h2>
<p>When the Subject is a Pronoun (this, that, etc.), and the Predicate a
Substantive, the Subject is commonly attracted in Greek into the gender
of the Predicate. Thus in English, if we were to say, ‘this is a stone,’
we should have no difficulty, as there are no genders concerned; but in
translating into Greek we should perhaps at first be disposed to put
‘this’ neuter, meaning ‘this thing.’ The Greek idiom, however, is to
make the gender of ‘this’ agree by attraction with the gender of
‘stone.’ Examples :—</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a stone. <br/>οὗτός ἐστι λίθος.</li>
<li>That was a dire calamity. <br/>ἐκείνη ἦν δεινὴ συμφορά.</li>
<li>What is this disease? <br/>τίς ἐστὶν αὕτη ἡ νόσος.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="use-of-ἕκαστος-and-ἐκάτερος.">§ 29. Use of ἕκαστος and
ἐκάτερος.</h2>
<p>The Distributive Pronouns ἑκάτερος and ἕκαστος have a special usage
which arises from the nature of the word. A Plural Nominative is, so to
speak, distributed into its component parts, and thus grammatically
ἕκαστος appears in apposition with a plural. And as in Latin suus and
quisque have a tendency to be close together, so in Greek ἕκαστος and
ἑαυτοῦ. Thus :—</p>
<ul>
<li>They went each to his own house. <br/>ἦλθον εἰς τὸν ἑαυτοῦ ἕκαστος
οἶκον.</li>
<li>The women were doing each thew own work. <br/>αἱ γυναῖκες τὸ αὑτῆς
ἑκάστη ἔργον εἰργάζοντο.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the sentence is of any length (or even sometimes in short
sentences), the Verb is singular to agree with ἕκαστος.</p>
<h2 id="use-of-neuter-adjective.">§ 30. Use of Neuter Adjective.</h2>
<p>Just as in the case of the Article we have seen that the Adjective is
used with Article in the neuter, where in English generally some
Substantive is employed, so frequently the Adjective (or Pronoun) is
used in the neuter (whether with or without Article), where in English
Substantives are required. This is especially the case where the
Substantive is of kindred meaning (cognate) with the Verb.</p>
<ul>
<li>He suffered terrible treatment. <br/>δεινὰ ἔπαθε.</li>
<li>They tell strange tales. <br/>θαυμάσια μυθολογοῦσι.</li>
<li>He made the following reply. <br/>τοιάδε ἀπεκρίνατο.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="predicative-adjective.">§ 31. Predicative Adjective.</h2>
<p>We have seen that if the Adjective has not the Article and the
Substantive has, the Adjective is used with a predicative meaning,
as—</p>
<ul>
<li>The man is bad. <br/>κακὸς ὁ ἀνήρ.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is obvious enough in the Nominative; but in Greek this
predicative use of the Adjective without Article is extended also to
other cases (known as Tertiary Predicate).</p>
<ul>
<li>The house you have is large. <br/>μεγάλην τὴν οἰκίαν ἔχεις.</li>
<li>Great was the enthusiasm with which we followed him <br/>πολλῇ τῇ
προθυμίᾳ συνειπόμεθα αὐτῷ.</li>
<li>Splendid was the city he ruled. <br/>ἰσχυρᾶς τῆς πόλεως ἦρχε.</li>
</ul>
<p>So where in English the predicative form is not used: often in
speaking of qualities or parts of the body :—</p>
<ul>
<li>He had large ears. <br/>μεγάλα εἶχε τὰ ὦτα.</li>
<li>I have a rough temper. <br/>τραχεῖαν ἔχω τὴν ὀργήν.</li>
<li>He looked with unflinching eyes. <br/>ὀρθοῖς τοῖς ὄμμασιν
ἔβλεψε.</li>
</ul>
<p>So again, where the adjective describes rather the result of the
action (proleptic), which in English may be expressed variously :—</p>
<ul>
<li>Raising his voice he spoke. <br/>μεγάλῃ τῇ φωνῇ εἶπε. <br/>(With the
voice high.)</li>
<li>Composing his face toa solemn look. <br/>σεμνὴν διαθεὶς τῆν ὄψιν.
<br/>(Composing his face solemn.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="δῆλος-and-φανερός.">§ 32. δῆλος and φανερός.</h2>
<p>There is a special idiom in the construction οὗ δῆλος and φανερός,
also due to attraction. See ὃ 26.</p>
<p>In English we say, ‘It is evident that you are ill;’
‘that-you-are-ill’ being logically the subject of the verb ‘is-evident.’
In Greek, however, the person is made the subject, and the sentence
becomes ‘You are evident being ill,’ or δῆλος εἶ νοσῶν, In the following
examples the English is purposely varied :—-</p>
<ul>
<li>It became clear that she was mad. <br/>φανερὰ ἐγένετο μαινομένη.
-You will be proved to have erred. <br/>δῆλοι γενήσεσθε ἁμαρτόντες.</li>
<li>It was evident they would die. <br/>φανεροὶ ἦσαν θανούμενοι.</li>
<li>I saw the enemy had failed. <br/>δῆλός μοι ἦν σφαλεὶς ὁ
πολέμιος.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="πολύς-and-μέγας.">§ 33. πολύς and μέγας.</h2>
<p>When ‘many’ is used with another adjective, in Greek — often καὶ is
inserted between the two: we say in English ‘many wonderful laws;’ in
Greek they say ‘many and wonderful.’ As—</p>
<ul>
<li>Many strange marvels. <br/>πολλὰ καὶ δεινὰ θαύματα.</li>
<li>Many clever things were said. <br/>πολλὰ καὶ σοφὰ ἐλέγετο.</li>
</ul>
<p>So again with the adjective ‘great’ :—</p>
<ul>
<li>A great fat man. <br/>ἀνήρ μέγας καὶ παχύς.</li>
<li>A large black chest. <br/>μεγάλη καὶ μέλαινα θήκη.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-cases.">THE CASES.</h1>
<p><strong>§ 34.</strong> The use of the Cases will be best learnt by
degrees, through the process of finding what each word governs, and so
fixing the general principles in the mind. But it may be of some use to
the learner to give a few general hints about them, to which he can
refer from time to time.</p>
<h2 id="the-nominative.">The Nominative.</h2>
<p>The Nominative is used exactly as in English, or any other language,
as the subject of the verb. No rule is required.</p>
<p>After Passives, Substantive Verbs, etc., it is used exactly as in
Latin. Thus :—</p>
<ul>
<li>He is good. <br />οὗτός ἐστιν ἀγαθός.</li>
<li>She is trying to be thought beautiful. <br />πειρᾶται καλὴ
νομίζεσθαι,</li>
<li>We are called just. <br />δίκαιοι καλούμεθα.</li>
</ul>
<p>In one use only does Greek differ from other inflected languages with
regard to the Nominative, and that is in what is called the Nominative
Attraction. When in a clause of oratio obliqua the subject is the same
as that of the principal verb, it is Nominative and not (as in Latin)
Accusative. Thus :—</p>
<ul>
<li>I say that you are good. <br />φημί σε ἀγαθὸν εἶναι.</li>
<li>I say that I am good. <br />φημὶ ἀγαθὸς εἶναι.</li>
</ul>
<p>So with Participles —</p>
<ul>
<li>I know that you are good. <br />οἶδά σε ἀγαθὸν ὄντα.</li>
<li>I know that I am good. <br />οἶδα ἀγαθὸς ὤν.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the principle which determines whether Infinitive or Participle
is to be used, see below, § 40.</p>
<h2 id="genitive-case.">§ 35. Genitive Case.</h2>
<p>To understand fully all the uses of the Genitive case requires a long
and difficult study, which it would be out of place to ’pursue here, but
the learner may be helped even in the early stages by noticing the main
usages,</p>
<p>(a.) Genitive of aim.</p>
<ul>
<li>To shoot at a mark. <br />τοξεύειν σκοποῦ. <br />(So στοχάζομαι,
ἐφίεσθαι, etc.)</li>
<li>Go home-wards. <br />ἐπ’ οἴκου ἰέναι.</li>
</ul>
<p>On this principle most verbs of aiming at, feeling after, desiring,
perceiving (taste, smell, touch, listen to), etc., have the
Genitive.</p>
<p>Such also is the special use of τοῦ μὴ to express the object of a
verb or act :—</p>
<ul>
<li>They ran, with the aim of not being caught. <br />ἀπέδραμον τοῦ μὴ
ἁλῶναι.</li>
</ul>
<p>(b.) Connected with this is the Genitive of respect or reference, a
large class: the English uses corresponding are very various, being
rendered by the prepositions ‘in regard to,’ ‘in respect of,’ ‘for,’
‘in,’ and very commonly ‘of.’ It describes the point <em>in which</em>
the Verb or Adjective employed is applicable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Skilled in the art. <br />ἐπιστήμων τῆς τέχνης.</li>
<li>Enviable for wisdom. <br />ζηλωτὸς τῆς σοφίας.</li>
</ul>
<p>So with many words describing ‘emptiness’ or ‘fulness,’ as πένεσθαι,
πλουτεῖν, πληρὴς, κενός, δεῖ, ἐνδεής, δεῖσθαι, πίμπλασθαι, γέμειν,
etc.</p>
<p>So special idioms, like</p>
<ul>
<li>Having broken his head. <br />κατεαγὼς τῆς κεφαλῆς. [lit. being
broken in respect of . . .]</li>
</ul>
<p>So also after many words which in English are transitive, and take
Accusative, but in Greek are intransitive, and take Genitive to describe
the thing or respect in which the Verb applies.</p>
<p>Such words are φείδομαι (spare), κρατεῖν (govern), ἔχεσθαι (clasp),
λανθάνομαι (forget), ἀμελεῖν (neglect), ἐπιμελεῖσθαι (nanage).</p>
<p>The Adjectives and Substantives corresponding to such words will
naturally govern the same case.</p>
<ul>
<li>Neglect of this. <br />ἀμέλεια τούτου.</li>
<li>To have care for mankind. <br />ἐπιμέλειαν τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἔχειν.</li>
</ul>
<p>So Prepositions describing local relation :—</p>
<ul>
<li>ὑπό, literally beneath of, beneath as regards, and so simply
under.</li>
<li>ἐπί, upon.</li>
<li>περί, about, around.</li>
<li>ὑπέρ, above.</li>
<li>πρό, before.</li>
<li>πρός, in front of, on the side of.</li>
<li>πέρα, beyond.</li>
<li>διά, through, and metaphorically by means of.</li>
<li>ἀντί, in front af.</li>
</ul>
<p>(c.) Connected with this again are a variety of usages expressing
relations between Substantives, such as are in Latin already familiar as
rendered by Genitive, and in English are given mostly by ’ of.’</p>
<p>Examples of the leading kinds under this head :—</p>
<ul>
<li>The father of the man. <br />ὁ πατὴρ τοῦ ἀνδρός (Possessive).</li>
<li>Wall of eight furlongs. <br />ὀκτὼ σταδίων τεῖχος
(Descriptive).</li>
<li>The most of the soldiers. <br /> οἱ πολλοὶ τῶν στρατιωτῶν
(Partitive).</li>
</ul>
<p>So with Verbs describing partition, as μετέχειν (shure), μεταλαβεῖν
(partake of), συμβάλλομαι (contribute to).</p>
<p>(d.) The Genitive is used after Comparatives, where we use ’than.”<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Here it corresponds to Latin
ablative. Example :—</p>
<ul>
<li>He is better than his father. <br />ἀμείνων ἐστι τοῦ πατρός.</li>
</ul>
<p>(e.) The Genitive is used (like the Latin ablative) to express
separation or motion ‘from.’</p>
<ul>
<li>To retire from the walls. <br />τῶν τειχῶν ἀποχωρεῖν.</li>
</ul>
<p>So with words meaning ‘to cease from,’ ‘to change from,’ ‘to keep
aloof from,’ etc., ἀπὸ στερεῖν (to deprive), ἁμαρτάνειν (to miss): and
all prepositions meaning ‘from,’ or ’ without,’ or ‘out of,’ ἀπό, ἄνευ,
δίχα, ἐκ, πρός (at hands of), παρά (from side of).</p>
<p>So also <em>origin</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Born of a wise mother. <br />μητρὸς σοφῆς γεγονώς.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Of Time.—The Genitive is used to express the time within which… |
|</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>In the night. <br />νυκτός.</li>
<li>Within three days. <br />τριῶν ἡμερῶν.</li>
</ul>
<p>And after a Negative it corresponds to English for.</p>
<ul>
<li>For twenty years I never went away. <br />εἰκόσιν ἐτῶν οὐδέποτε
ἀπεδήμησα.</li>
<li>For two months I earned nothing. <br />δυοῖν μηνοῖν οὐδένα μισθὸν
ἔλαβον.</li>
</ul>
<p>So</p>
<ul>
<li>Once a year (really partitive). <br />ἅπαξ τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ.</li>
</ul>
<p>(g.) With a Participle, as Genitive absolute.</p>
<ul>
<li>While the sun was setting. <br />δύοντος τοῦ ἡλίου.</li>
<li>As they had not come. <br />τούτων οὐκ ἀφικομένων.</li>
<li>If no one aids. <br />μηδενὸς ἐπαρκοῦντος.</li>
</ul>
<p>(h.) Of Price.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How much is this sold for? <br />πόσου τάδε πωλεῖται;</p></li>
<li><p>I have not the wherewithal to buy it. <br />οὐκ ἔχω οὖ
ὠνήσομαι.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These are the main heads: but the details of the special usages of
the Genitive, what Verbs and Prepositions govern it, must be learnt by
slowly gathored experience.</p>
<h2 id="accusative.">§ 36. Accusative.</h2>
<p>(a.) The common use, as the object of Transitive Verbs.</p>
<ul>
<li>I killed him. <br /> ἔκτεινα αὐτόν.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is so familiar from Latin and other languages that no more need
be said.. So Prepositions of motion to, πρός, ἐς. παρά (to beside), ἐπί
(like English ’ on to’), ὑπό (to under).</p>
<p>(b.) To express extent of space or time (like Latin).</p>
<ul>
<li>I was ill for three days. <br />τρεῖς ἡμέρας ἐνόσουν.</li>
<li>It is five furlongs off. <br />πέντε σταδίους ἀπέχει.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, Prepositions which have notion of movement along :— παρὰ,
alongside of, and metaphorically aside of, contrary to. κατὰ, down
along, and metaphorically according to, opposite to. ἀνὰ, up along, and
metaphorically according w. περὶ, round along, and metaphorically
concerned with.</p>
<p>(c.) Cognate (like Latin).</p>
<ul>
<li>He went his own way. <br />τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ὁδὸν ἀπῆλθε.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, without substantive :—</p>
<ul>
<li>He sinned many sins. <br />πολλὰ ἥμαρτε.</li>
<li>He inflicted no injury on me. <br />οὐδὲν ἐμὲ ἠδίκει.</li>
</ul>
<p>(d.) Respect (also like Latin).</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a headache. <br />ἀλγῶ τὴν κεφαλήν.</li>
<li>Royal in race. <br />βασιλικὸς τὸ γένος.</li>
<li>Superior to Corinth in size. <br />κρείσσων τῆς Κορίνθου τὸ
μέγεθος.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will be observed with regard to this last usage that the Dative is
used in a very similar way; and in many cases either would do to express
the sense equally well.</p>
<h2 id="dative.">§ 37. Dative.</h2>
<p>(a.) Time: ‘at,’ or ‘on.’</p>
<ul>
<li>On that night. <br />ἐκείνῃ τῇ νυκτὶ.</li>
<li>On the next day. <br />τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ.</li>
<li>In the former year. <br />τῷ προτέρῳ ἐνιαυτῷ.</li>
<li>To-morrow. <br />τῇ αὐρίον.</li>
</ul>
<p>Somewhat similar are <em>ἐν τούτῳ, ἐν ᾧ, meanwhile, whilst.</em></p>
<p>(6.) After ordinary Verbs, of person or things affected, like English
‘to,’ and Latin Dative.</p>
<ul>
<li>I give it to him. <br />δίδωμι αὐτῷ.</li>
<li>He was slave to the king. <br />τῷ βασιλεῖ ἐδούλευε.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also (like Genitive) with Verbs which in English are transitive,
where in Greek the Dative describes the person affected.</p>
<ul>
<li>I aided you. <br />ἐπήρκεσα ὑμῖν (so ἀμύνειν, βοηθεῖν).</li>
<li>We served him. <br />ὑπηρετοῦμεν αὐτῷ.</li>
</ul>
<p>(c.) Ethic: of person affected, where, however, the sentence is
grammatically complete without it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Climb the ladder I pray. <br />ἀνάβαινέ μοι τὴν κλίμακα.</li>
<li>Who of your friends is dead? <br />τίς τέθνηκέ σοι;</li>
</ul>
<p>This usage also familiar in Latin.</p>
<p>(d.) Of the instrument, after any Verb or Adjective.</p>
<ul>
<li>He strikes me with his hand. <br />παίει με τῇ χειρί.</li>
<li>Stiff with cold. <br />ψύχει στερρός.</li>
<li>He frightened him urth his insolence. <br />ἐξέπληξεν αὐτὸν τῇ
ὕβρει.</li>
<li>Hot with anger. <br />ὀργῇ θερμὸς.</li>
<li>He died of hunger. <br />λιμῷ ἀπώλετο.</li>
<li>Demoralised by wealth. <br />πλούτῳ μαλακισθείς.</li>
</ul>
<p>(e.) Of the manner.</p>
<ul>
<li>He found it in a strange way. <br />θαυμασίῳ τρόπῳ ἐξεῦρε.</li>
<li>He helped me with great zeal. <br />πολλῃ προθυμίᾳ ἐβοήθει μοι.</li>
</ul>
<p>(f.) Often of the ’ point in which,’ or ‘respect.’</p>
<ul>
<li>Inferior in strength. <br />φαῦλος τῇ δυνάμει.</li>
<li>A man, Snooks by name. <br />ἀνὴρ ὀνόματι Σνῶξ.</li>
</ul>
<p>So ἔργῳ, λόγῳ, γνώῤῃ, ἴσχνι, προφάσει, etc.</p>
<p>(g.) So again, as in Latin and English, of nearness and likeness,
etc., after such words as</p>
<ul>
<li>ὅμοιος, ἔοικε, εἰκάζω, ὁ αὐτός, παραπλήσιος, ἐναντίος, ἐγγύς,
προσήκει, πρέπει, ἐπιτήδειος, σύμφωνος, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>On this principle the Dative follows words like—I am present
(πάρειμι), I live with (παροικῶ), and prepositions describing proximity
of various kinds.</p>
<ul>
<li>παρά, by side of, at house of.</li>
<li>ἐπί, on top of, and metaph. on condition of, with view to, in
addition to.</li>
<li>πρός, near to, and metaph. in addition to.</li>
<li>ὑπέρ, above (rare: usually genitive).</li>
<li>περί, about (rare: usually genitive).</li>
<li>ὑπό, under (but often genitive).</li>
<li>σύν, with (always dative),</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="case-after-verb-to-be-or-passive.">§ 38. Case after Verb ‘to
be,’ or Passive.</h2>
<p>After Passives or Verbs ‘to be,’ ’ to become,’ ’ to appear,’ the
construction of the person is continued unbroken; i.e. Adjectives or
Predicate Substantives are in the same case as the foregoing Substantive
or Pronoun. This construction is familiar from Latin. The rule given, §
34, about the Nominative, is clearly only a special case of this—</p>
<ul>
<li>The man was good. <br />ὁ ἀνὴρ ἦν ἀγαθός.</li>
<li>They were said to be women. <br />γυναῖκες ἐλέγοντο εἶναι.</li>
<li>It is open to me to become a king. <br />ἔξεστί μοι βασιλεῖ
γενέσθαι.</li>
<li>I said he was called Athenian. <br />τοῦτον ἔφην Ἀθηνάϊον
καλεῖσθαι.</li>
<li>By those who seemed to be friends. <br />ὑπὸ τῶν δοκούντων φίλων
εἶναι.</li>
<li>These things being ready. <br />τούτων ἑτοίμων ὄντων.</li>
</ul>
<p>In many cases the Accusative-Infinitive construction is substituted.
Thus you can say—</p>
<ul>
<li>I ask you to be ready. <br />δεόμαί σον προθύμου εἶναι, or πρόθυμον
εἶναι.</li>
<li>It seemed bést to take up our arms and go. <br />ἔδοξεν ἡμῖν τὰ ὅπλα
λαβοῦσιν ἀπιέναι, or λαβόντας.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="use-of-infinitive.">USE OF INFINITIVE.</h1>
<h2 id="prolate.">§ 39. (1.) Prolate.</h2>
<p>Besides the prolate use of the Infinitive, which is common in all
languages, 6.6. after Verbs like ‘I wish,’ ‘I learn,’ ‘I can,’ ‘I
purpose,’ and Adjectives like ‘able,’ ’ easy,’ ’ eager,’ there are other
uses of the Infinitive in Greek not corresponding to the English idiom.
A few of the chief examples are given below.</p>
<p>Prolate, but where English idiom is different.</p>
<ul>
<li>Capable of ruling. <br />ἱκανὸς ἄρχειν.</li>
<li>He had a custom of going. <br />ἔθος ἦν τούτῳ ἰέναι.</li>
<li>Clever at carrying. <br />δεινὸς φέρειν.</li>
<li>I am in hopes of gowng. <br />ἐν ἐλπίδι εἰμὶ ἰέναι.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="accusative-and-nominative-with-the-infinitive.">§ 40. (2.)
Accusative and Nominative with the Infinitive.</h2>
<p>After Verbs of saying and thinking, ‘that’ in English is often
translated literally into Greek by ὅτι; but often also the idiom of the
Accusative and Infinitive is employed as in Latin; the learner will be
already familiar with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>He said that tt was ready. <br />ἕτοιμον εἶναι ἔφη.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only observe, if the subject of the Infinitive Verb is the same as
the subject of the principal Verb, it is Nominative, not Accusative.</p>
<ul>
<li>He said she was beautiful, but he was ugly. <br />ἐκείνην μὲν καλὴν
ἔφη εἶναι, αὐτός δὲ αἰσχρός.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note.—After Verbs of feeling and knowing, a Participle is used
instead of Infinitive. See § 51 and § 34 above.</p>
<h2 id="infinitive-and-article.">§ 41. (3.) Infinitive and Article.</h2>
<p>The Article is used with the Infinitive, where we use an
abstract-substantive or a periphrasis. It has been all explained above
on the Article, § 8.</p>
<h2 id="idioms-with-infinitive.">§ 42. Idioms with Infinitive.</h2>
<p>There are certain special uses of verbs with the Infinitive which
have to be learnt, as they could not be inferred from English, or from
general principles of grammar. For example :—</p>
<ul>
<li>I know how to do tu. <br />ἐπίσταμαι δρᾶν.</li>
</ul>
<p>[Compare Participial use :— <br />I know I am doing. ἐπίσταμαι
δρῶν.]</p>
<ul>
<li>I appear to do it. <br />φαίνομαι δρᾶν.</li>
</ul>
<p>[Compare Participial use :— <br />I am proved to be doing tt.
<br />φαίνομαι δρῶν.]</p>
<ul>
<li>I promise to do it. <br />ὑπισχνοῦμαι δρᾶν, or δράσειν, or
δρᾶσαι.</li>
<li>I am about to do it. <br />μέλλω δρᾶν, or δράσειν, or δρᾶσαι.</li>
<li>I hope to do it. <br />ἐλπίζω δρᾶν, or δράσειν, or δρᾶσαι.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="participle.">PARTICIPLE.</h1>
<p><strong>§ 43.</strong> The Participle is used much more in Greek than
in modern English, and, though the uses of it are easy and natural, even
the simplest narrative is so improved by properly employing it, that the
point deserves careful attention.</p>
<p>We should first notice some special uses of the Participle with other
verbs, where the Greek idiom differs from the English.</p>
<dl>
<dt>τυγχάνω.</dt>
<dd>
He chanced to come. <br />ἔτυχεν ἐλθών.
</dd>
<dt>ἥδομαι.</dt>
<dd>
I take delight in doing. <br />ἥδομαι ποιῶν
</dd>
<dt>χαίρω.</dt>
<dd>
I should be pleased to get. <br />χαίροιμι ἂν λαβὼν.
</dd>
<dt>παύομαι.</dt>
<dd>
He ceased to run. <br />ἐπαύσατο τρέχων.
</dd>
<dt>λανθάνω.</dt>
<dd>
I came without their knowing. <br />ἔλαθον αὐτοὺς ἐλθών.
</dd>
<dd>
He did it without knowing. <br />ἔλαθεν ἑαυτόν δράσας.
</dd>
<dt>φθάνω.</dt>
<dd>
He seized him in time before he could jump down. <br />συλλαβὼν ἔφθασε
πρὶν καταπηδᾶν.
</dd>
<dd>
He arrived in time before the surrender. <br />ἀφικόμενος ἔφθασε πρὶν
προδοθῆναι τὴν πόλιν.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The ordinary idiomatic uses include a variety of clauses, where the
Participle has very different effects upon the meaning; sometimes it
gives a relation of time, sometimes of cause, sometimes of instrument,
and so forth.</p>
<p>The case of the Participle naturally varies. Sometimes it agrees with
the Substantive which is the subject or object of the sentence;
sometimes, where the subject is changed, it will naturally be in the
Genitive Absolute. The learner will be familiar with this principle from
Latin, where the ablative is so used absolute; or if not, the examples
will make it quite clear.</p>
<h2 id="a.-temporal.">§ 44. a. Temporal.</h2>
<p>(1.) Where two or more actions are related, and in English Principal
Verbs are used, and the verbs are connected by ’ and.’</p>
<ul>
<li>He came and spoke. <br />ἐλθὼν ἔλεξε.</li>
<li>I stayed behind and worked. <br />ὑπομένων ἐπόνουν.</li>
<li>He asked her to take it and break it. <br />λαβοῦσαν διαρρῆξαι.</li>
</ul>
<p>So Genitive Absolute, with subject changed :—</p>
<ul>
<li>They were present and saw it, and he was tortured. <br />παοόντων
ἐκείνων καὶ ὁρώντων ἐβασανίζετο.</li>
</ul>
<p>(2.) Where in English Participles are employed, but often with
prepositions, as on, after, in, or conjunctions, as wihile, when, the
tense is determined by the sense; see Tenses,</p>
<ul>
<li>I saw him in passing. <br />παριὼν εἶδον.</li>
<li>When working I am happy. <br />ἐν ἔργῳ ὧν εὖ ἔχω, or ἥδομαι.</li>
<li>While wandering he fell in with me. <br />ἀλώμενος περιέτυχέ
μοι.</li>
<li>On hearing this she fell down. <br />τοῦτο ἀκούσασα κατέπεσε.</li>
<li>After waiting some time, I ran off. <br />χρόνον τινὰ ἐπισχὼν
ἀπέδραμον.</li>
</ul>
<p>So Genitive Absolute, with new subject :—</p>
<ul>
<li>On their assenting he swore. <br />συναινεσάντων ἐκείνων ὤμοσε.</li>
<li>He marched with his soldiers following. <br />ἑπομένων τῶν
στρατιωτῶν ἐπορεύετο.</li>

as when, while, as.</p>
<ul>
<li>As he saw it he was pleased. <br />ἰδὼν ἤσθη.</li>
<li>He was at a loss when he heard. <br />ἀκούσας ἠπόρει.</li>

<p>So with Genitive Absolute, subject changed :—</p>
<ul>
<li>When three days had elapsed they came back. <br />τριῶν ἡμερῶν
γενομένων ἧκον.</li>
<li>When night arrived. <br />νυκτὸς ἐπιγενομένης.</li>
<li>He departed while it was still night. <br />ἀπῄει νυκτὸς ἔτι
οὔσης.</li>
</ul>
<p>(4.) Where in English Abstract Substantives are used with
Prepositions.</p>
<ul>
<li>He waited in the hope. <br />ἐλπίζων περιέμενε.</li>
<li>In great alarm she cried out. <br />ἡ δὲ μέγα φοβουμένη ἐβόησε.</li>
<li>At the sight she fled. <br />ἰδοῦσα ἔφυγε.</li>
<li>We watch you at work. <br />πονοῦντα θεωροῦμέν σε.</li>
</ul>
<p>So with Genitive Absolute, subject changed :—</p>
<ul>
<li>On their departure she died. <br />ἀπελθόντων ἐκείνων
ἐτελεύτησε.</li>
<li>Amid the silence of all he departed. <br />σιγώντων ἁπάντων

<p>The Comparison is commonly made in English by a clause with a

</ul>
<p>In English, often a variety of expressions may be turned with ws and
the causal participle, such as alleging, on the understanding that, on
the plea that, imagining that.</p>
<ul>
<li>I will retire on the plea that you hate me. <br />ἀπωχωρήσω ὡς σοῦ
μισοῦντος ἐμέ.</li>
<li>They came on the understanding that no one would see them.
<br />ἦλθον ὡς οὐδενὸς ὀψομένου.</li>
<li>They asked to be forgiven, alleging ignorance. <br />ξυγγνώμην
ᾔτησαν ὡς ἀγνοοῦντες.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-often-ὡς.">§ 48. Final (often ὡς).</h2>
<p>The Future Participle is used in Greek to express purpose, often with
ws, sometimes with the Article.</p>
<ul>
<li>He sent a soldier to inquire. <br />ἐρωτήσοντα ἀπέπεμψε
στρατιώτην.</li>
<li>They started to overtake him. <br />ἀπεχώρησαν ὡς

<li>I shall send messengers to inform you. <br />πέμψω τοὺς
ἀγγελοῦντας.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conditional-use.">§ 49. Conditional Use.</h1>
<p>Often the Participial Clause stands for a supposition : the
Participle often being followed not unnaturally by the enclitic
<em>γε</em>, which means ‘at least.’</p>
<ul>
<li>Ιf you go away, you will find. <br />ἀπιὼν εὑρήσεις.</li>
<li>If he is here, I shall rescue him. <br />σώσω αὐτὸν παρόντα γε.</li>

<p>So Genitive Absolute, with changed subject :—</p>
<ul>
<li>If you help me, I can accomplish it. <br />σοῦ γε ἐπαρκοῦντος οἷός

<p>N.B.—In this use the Negative is μή.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are not present, I shall be helpless. <br />σοῦ μὴ παρόντος

<li>If I do not do it, I shall be put to death. <br />μὴ δρῶν
ἀποθανοῦμαι.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="concessive-use.">§ 50. Concessive Use.</h2>
<p>Where in English we use ‘though’ and a verb, in Greek often the
Participle and καίπερ, ‘even,’ is used, referring to a noun or pronoun
already in the sentence, with no alteration of the case.</p>
<ul>
<li>Though old, he ran. <br />καίπερ γέρων ὧν ἔτρεχε.</li>
<li>He killed her, though she was his mother. <br />ἔκτεινεν αὐτὴν
καίπερ μητέρα οὖσαν.</li>
<li>Though they were strong, he gave them orders. <br />ἐπέτασσεν αὐτοῖς
καίπερ ἰσχυροῖς οὖσιν.</li>
</ul>
<p>So Genitive Absolute, with subject changed :—</p>
<ul>
<li>Though many were present, he bathed. <br />καίπερ πολλῶν παρόντων
ἐλούετο.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>§ 51.</strong> Observe also that a Participle is used for the
dependent clause after verbs of knowing and feeling (just as Infinitives
are used for dependent clauses after verbs of saying and thinking). See
§ 40.</p>
<ul>
<li>I know that she is present. <br />ἐπίσταμαι αὐτὴν παροῦσαν.</li>
<li>Do you not perceive it is disgraceful? <br />οὐκ αἰσθάνει αἰσχρὸν
ὄν;</li>
</ul>
<p>And the same rule holds here too, that the Nominative is used and not
the Accusative, where the subject, of the two clauses is the same.</p>
<ul>
<li>She knew that she would die. <br />θανουμένη ᾔδη.</li>
<li>I percewe I am ill. <br />νοσῶν αἰσθάνομαι.</li>
<li>They discovered they were deceived. <br />ἔγνωσαν ἠπατημένον.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="participle-omitted-in-english.">§ 52. Participle omitted in
English.</h2>
<p>The Participle (especially ὦν, being) is sometimes required in Greek
where in English it is omitted altogether. This is chiefly in
appositions, or where an attributive or descriptive sentence is added to
a Substantive, as is often done in English without any Participle or
Verb. The examples will make this more clear.</p>
<ul>
<li>There was an Aethop, cruel in disposition. <br />Αἰθίοψ ἦν τις ὠμὸς
ὢν τὴν διάνοιαν.</li>
<li>Socrates, once my friend, lately died. <br />Σωκράτης, πάλαι ποτὲ ὧν
μοι φίλος, νεωστὶ ἐτελεύτησεν.</li>
<li>I met my father without his coat. <br />τὸν πατέρα εἶδον ἄνευ τοῦ
ἱματίου ὄντα.</li>
<li>The Chians, men always without faith, revolted. <br />ἀπέστησαν οἱ
Χῖοι, ἄνθρωποι ὄντες ἀεὶ ἄπιστοι.</li>
<li>Together we are strong: separate, weak. <br />συνειλεγμένοι μὲν
ἰσχυροί ἐσμεν, καθ´ ἕκαστον δὲ γενόμενοι, ἀσθενεῖς.</li>
</ul>
<p>[In many cases of apposition the clause can be turned in Greek eifher
with Article or with Participle, as—</p>
<ul>
<li>The lion, the father of the cubs… <br />ὁ λέων, ὁ πατὴρ τῶν σκύμνων,
or πατὴρ ὦν.</li>
<li>The Getae, the remotest of savages…<br />οἱ Γέται, of ἔσχατοι τῶν
βαρβάρων, or ἔσχατοι ὄντες.]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="relative-and-participle.">§ 53. Relative and Participle.</h2>
<p>There is a little point with reference to the use of Relative and
Participle which needs clearing up, as confusing rules are sometimes
given about it. Compare these two sentences :—</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I met a Boeotian and a Megarian: the Boeotian, who was ill, could
scarcely walk.</li>
<li>Two Boeotians I met, a healthy man and an invalid: the Boeotian who
was ill could scarcely walk.</li>
</ol>
<p>In (1) the relative clause <em>who was ill</em> is part of what is
told about the Boeotian, i.e. practically part of the predicate.</p>
<p>In (2) the relative clause is part of the attribute, i.e. belongs to
the subject.</p>
<p>Accordingly in Greek the two sentences become—</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Βοιωτῶ τινί καὶ Μεγαρεῖ? ἐνέτυχον· ὁ δὲ Βοιωτὸς, νόσον ἔχων,
μόλις ἐδύνατο βαδίζειν.</p></li>
<li><p>Βοιωτοῖν δυοῖν ἐνέτυχον, τῷ μὲν εὖ ἔχοντι τῷδὲ ἑτέρῳ νοσοῦντι· ὁ
δὲ Βοιωτὸς ὁ νόσων ἔχων μόλις ἐδύνατο βαδίζειν.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="tense-idioms.">TENSE IDIOMS.</h1>
<p><strong>§ 54.</strong> There are tenses in Greek corresponding to
most (though not all) of the English tenses, and in the Grammars, from
which we first learn Greek, the corresponding English tenses are given
as equivalents for the Greek tenses. But as in several points the idiom
or usage differs, the learner is often misled by such translations in
the Grammar. It is necessary, therefore, to consider these idiomatic
usages in detail; and as we are here proceeding from English to Greek,
the clearest method seems to be to take the English tenses in order, and
see what becomes of them in Greek.</p>
<h2 id="english-present-indicative.">English Present Indicative.</h2>
<p>We have here two tenses, e.g. ‘I learn,’ and ‘I am learning,’ the
former being an act (either single or repeated), and the latter a
process or extended act.</p>
<p>Both are usually represented by the Greek Present Indicative.</p>
<p>Note, however, that sometimes when the act spoken of is <em>just
over</em>, English uses the Present when Greek prefers the Aorist. Thus
we often find—</p>
<ul>
<li>You speak well (speech being over). <br />καλῶς ἔλεξας.</li>
<li>Do you ask me that? (question already asked.) <br />πότερον ταῦτα
ἤρου;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="english-imperfect.">§ 55. English Imperfect.</h2>
<p>This is the same in Greek as in English.</p>
<ul>
<li>I was learning. <br />ἐμάνθανον.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, however, that the English Imperfect is sometimes due to
<em>oratio obliqua</em>; the tense being really Present if the statement
or question were put directly instead of indirectly. In this case the
Greek does not change the tense from what it would be in oratio recta.
Thus :—</p>
<ul>
<li><p>He said that he was sick. (What he said was, ‘I am sick.’)
<br />ἔλεξεν ὅτι νοσεῖ.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I asked why he was sick. (What I asked was, ‘Why are you
sick’?)<br />ἠρόμην τί νοσεῖ.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="english-perfect.">§ 56. English Perfect.</h2>
<p>Greeks use Perfect much less and Aorist much more than we do: the
Perfect in English therefore often corresponds to the Aorist in Greek,
chiefly when there is no emphasis on the <em>effect still lαsting</em>.
’Thus :—</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at the book I have bought. <br />ἰδοὺ τὸ βιβλίον ὅπερ
ἐωνησάμην.</li>
<li>I approve what you have said. <br />ἐπαινῶ ὅσα ἔλεξας.</li>
<li>We have found it useful. <br />ὠφέλιμον εὕρομεν.</li>
</ul>
<p>(2.) The English use Perfect sometimes where Greeks use Present;
namely, when describing a pust state extending up to the present.</p>
<ul>
<li>For ten years I have been ill. <br />δέκα ἔτη νοσῶ.</li>
<li>We have been long looking for you. <br />πάλαι σε ζητοῦμεν.</li>
<li>All this time he has been cheating me. <br />τοσοῦτον χρόνον ἐξαπατᾷ
με.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="english-pluperfect.">§ 57. English Pluperfect.</h2>
<p>In speaking of past things (telling stories, narrating history,
etc.), the Pluperfect is often required in English to describe the
events of a point of time <em>still further back</em> than the one with
which the sentence is chiefly concerned. In Greek, the common idiom is
far less precise in the matter of time; both events being past, both are
commonly Aorist or Imperfect. A few illustrations will show this.</p>
<ul>
<li>It did not at all turn out as he had expected. (Expectation previous
to event.) <br />οὐχ ὡς προσεδέχετο οὐδαμῶς ἀπέβη.</li>
<li>When the ships he had ordered arrived, he set sail. (Order previous
to arrival and sailing). <br />ἀφικομένων τῶν νεῶν ἃς μετεπέμψατο, εὐθὺς
ἀνήγετο.</li>
<li>He explained tt all. For the friend had come. (Coming previous to
explanation.) <br />ἐδήλωσε τὸ πᾶν. ἦλθε γὰρ ὁ φίλος.</li>
<li>He met a man who formerly had been his friend (previous to meeting).
<br />ἀνδρὶ περιέτυχέ τινι ὂς πρότερον φίλος ἣν ἑαυτῷ.</li>
</ul>
<p>So constantly after ἐπεί, ἐπειδή, when, after that, the Aorist is
used where we use Pluperfect.</p>
<ul>
<li>When he had finished. <br />ἐπεὶ ἐξετέλεσε.</li>
<li>After he had gone away. <br />ἐπειδὴ ἀπῆλθε.</li>
</ul>
<p>So again the English Pluperfect is often due to orativ dbliqua (see §
55): and it stands for a Perfect in <em>oratio recta</em>; the Greek
tense will therefore still in many cases (§ 56) be Aorist, since
<em>oratio obliqua</em> does not in Greek alter tenses,</p>
<p>Thus, turning the clauses in § 56 into the oblique :—</p>
<ul>
<li>He asked me to look at the book he HAD bought. <br />ἤτησε με τὸ
βιβλίον σκοπεῖν ὅπερ ἐωνήσατο.</li>
<li>He said he approved what I HAD said. <br />ἐπαινεῖν ἔφη ὅσα
ἔλεξα.</li>
<li>I told him we HAD found it useful. <br />ἔλεξα ὅτι ὠφέλιμον
εὕρομεν.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="english-past-or-preterite-and-the-greek-imperfect-and-aorist.">§
58. English Past or Preterite and the Greek Imperfect and Aorist.</h2>
<p>The English Past Tense corresponds commonly to the Greek Aorist, and
then there is no difficulty; but also sometimes it is used where in
Greek the Imperfect would be more natural. It is easy to turn the Tenses
correctly if we remember that the Aorist in Greek expresses the Act, the
Imperfect the Process or the Hubit. Not unfrequently either will do, as
the act may be regarded, on the one hand, merely as an act without
reference to its duration, or, on the other, stress may be laid on its
taking time.</p>

<p>The Imperfect in Greck, describing the protracted or extended process
in the past, is often also used for a commenced or attempted action, and
so may correspond to a variety of English expressions, some of which are
given here.</p>
<ul>
<li>He was by way of denying. <br />ἀπηρνεῖτο.</li>

<h2 id="english-present-infinitive-and-greek-aorist-infinitive.">§ 61.
English Present Infinitive and Greek Aorist Infinitive.</h2>
<p>A common mistake is made by beginners in supposing the Aorist
Infinitive to describe a past action. This is only so where the
Infinitive is in oblique statement (oratio obliqua), and stands for a
Finite Verb.</p>
<p>Thus, <em>he said that he came (or had come)</em> is <em>ἔφη
ἐλθεῖν</em>.</p>
<p>But in sentences like <em>I wish to know, able to conquer, so as to
find,</em> it is quite as good Greek to use Aorist as Present, and we
might naturally say <em>βούλομαι γνῶναι, δυνατὸς νικῆσαι, ὥστε
εὑρεῖν</em>, no less than <em>γιγνώσκειν, νικᾶν, and εὑρίσκειν</em>.</p>
<h1 id="special-idiom.">SPECIAL IDIOM.</h1>
<p>After <em>ὑπισχνεῖσθαι, to promise, ἐλπίζω, to hope, μέλλω, to be

<p>The distinction between the Present and Aorist in each of these pairs
is a very fine one (Aorist, expressing the act; Present, extended act or
process), and as it is not observed in English it need not be attended
to in the early stages of composition.</p>
<p>But the learner should get into the habit of remembering the
existence of the Aorists when he has such clauses to translate, and
using them as well as the Present.</p>
<p>The Aorist in the Participle and Infinitive is for practical
convenience treated separately, though the principle of the usage is the
same. See §61,</p>
<h2 id="english-present-tense-passive.">§ 63. English Present Tense
Passive.</h2>
<p>The Present Passive in English corresponds to two different Greek
tenses according to circumstances, the Present and the Perfect.</p>
<p>(1.) Where <em>is-done</em> means is being done or is repeatedly
done, the Present is used.</p>
<ul>
<li>The salt 1s brought down in ships. <br />ναυσὶ τὸ ἅλας
κατακομίζεται.</li>
<li>The officers are elected by show of hands. <br />λοχαγοὶ
χειροτονοῦνται.</li>
<li>I am grieved to find. <br />λυποῦμαι αἰσθόμενος.</li>
</ul>
<p>(2.) Where is-done means 1s already done, use the Perfect.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am beaten in the fight. <br />τῇ μάχῃ νενίκημαι.</li>
<li>In the book it ts written. <br />ἐν τῇ συγγραφὴ εἴρηται.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="english-past-tense-passive.">§ 64. English Past Tense
Passive.</h2>
<p>So ‘was done’ in English may mean three things :—</p>
<p>(1.) ‘Was being done’ or ‘was often done.’ Greek Imperfect.</p>
<ul>
<li>The salt was brought down. <br />τὸ ἅλας κατεκομίζετο.</li>
<li>They were governed by kings. <br />ὑπὸ βασιλέων ἤρχοντο.</li>
<li>The children were taught by the State. <br />δημοσίᾳ ἐδιδάσκοντο οἱ
παῖδες.</li>
</ul>
<p>(2.) ‘Was done,’ single act: in Greek use the Aorist.</p>
<ul>
<li>The battle was won. <br />ἐνικήθησαν μάχῃ.</li>
<li>The town was taken. <br />ἑάλω ἡ πόλις;</li>
</ul>
<p>(3.) ‘Was already done,’ ‘were previously done:’ in Greek use the
Pluperfect.</p>
<ul>
<li>When I got there the enemy were defeated. <br />ἀφικομένου ἐμοῦ
ἐνενίκηντο οἱ πολέμιοι.</li>
<li>They did as they were told. <br />ἔδρασαν ὥσπερ εἴρητο.</li>

<p>(1.) Aorist Future, formed from Aorist (first and second Future).</p>
<p>(2.) Perfect Future, formed from Perfect (paulo-post-futurum, or
third Future).</p>
<p>The difference between them corresponds to the difference between the
Perfect and Aorist; Perfect describing the state, Aorist the act. Thus

<p>Often in English the simple Future is used for both, with exactly the
same ambiguity that we have noticed in the Present and Past of the
Passive voice. The student will, however, find no difficulty if he will
always think of the sense, and ask the simple question, Does it describe
the future act or the future state?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the ships go out, the treaty will be broken. <br />[Act]
λυθήσονται αἱ σπονδαί,</p></li>
<li><p>By the time you get home the treaty will be broken. <br />[State]

Perfect and Aorist, both of which are translated usually in Grammars,

both are rendered ‘having done.’ The learner, therefore, needs some
hints, in doing English into Greek, as to which he is to use.</p>
<p>The fact is, δράσας describes the mere act of doing, δεδρακώς the
state of having done; and which we use will, therefore, depend on the

<h2 id="english-participle-perfect-greek-present.">§ 67. English
Participle Perfect = Greek Present.</h2>
<p>On the other hand, the Greek Present Participle may be used where in
English we should use the Past. This will follow from the same principle
mentioned before, namely that in Greck the</p>
<ul>
<li>Aorist describes act simply,</li>
<li>Present describes act extended, or state of doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore if we say, ‘After having learnt music ten years, he was
still ignorant’ (the act being extended), the Participle in Greek will
naturally be Present, and it will run, ἔτη δέκα μανθάνων τὴν μουσικὴν
ἔτι ἠγνόει.</p>
<p>So in the following examples :—</p>
<ul>
<li>Having once associated with him often, he deserted him
<br />πρότερον πολλάκις συγγιγνόμενος ἀπέλιπε.</li>
<li>After having suffered long, he expired. <br />πολὺν χρόνον νοσῶν
ἐτελεύτησεν.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, however, the Present Participle usually has some word
to mark the time, like <em>πρότερον, ποτέ, πολὺν χρόνον,</em> etc.</p>
<h2 id="english-participle-present-greek-aorist.">§ 68. English
Participle Present =Greek Aorist.</h2>
<p>Observe, that in ordinary narrative, where there are two acts, and
the first is described by a Participle, the second by a Principal Verb,
the first in Greek is <em>Aorist</em>.</p>
<p>In English we often use the Present Participle for this, as will be
seen from the examples :—</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking the bag, he opened it. <br />λαβὼν τὸν θύλακον ἀνέῳξε.</li>
<li>Coming to him, he asked him. <br />ἀφικόμενος ᾔτησεν αὐτόν.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we used the Present Participle in Greek it would mean ‘while he
was taking, coming,’ etc., since the Present implies an act extended in
time, the Aorist an act simply. This principle being understood, the
learner will soon discern those cases where either tense may be used,
and those where they will more naturally be one or the other.</p>
<p>In the following kind of cases both will occur :—</p>
<ul>
<li>He learning this, and being indignant, answered. <br />μαθὼν τοῦτο
καὶ δεινὸν ποιούμενος ἀπεκρίνατο.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="indicative-optative-with-ἄν.">§ 69. Indicative Optative with
ἄν.</h2>
<p>It is not my intention in this book to enter into the difficult
syntax of the Optative, or the complications of the Conditional
Sentence; but the use of ἄν with the Optative and Indicative may be
readily learnt, even at an early stage, from one or two instances,</p>
<p>Where in English we say ‘I would or should do,’ in Greek is used the
Optative (Present or Aorist) with the Particle ἄν, and where we say ‘I
would or should have done,’ in Greek is used Indicative (Aorist) with
av.</p>
<p>(1.) Optative.</p>
<ul>
<li>I would go. <br /> ἴοιμι ἄν.</li>
<li>We should scarcely see. <br />μόλις ἂν σκεψαίμεθα,</li>
<li>They could not conquer. <br />οὐκ ἂν δύναιντο νικᾶν.</li>
</ul>
<p>(2.) Indicative.</p>
<ul>
<li>I should have come yesterday. <br />ἐχθὲς ἂν ἦλθον.</li>
<li>Who would have known it? <br />τίς ἂν ἔγνω;</li>
<li>All would have died. <br />ἀπέθανον ἂν πάντες.</li>
</ul>
<p>Observe that ἂν never comes first, and never in an emphatic
place.</p>
<h2 id="subjunctive-and-optative-of-purpose.">§ 70. Subjunctive and
Optative of Purpose.</h2>
<p>ἵνα, ὥς, and ὅπως are used in Greek to express purpose. The mood is
either Subjunctive or Optative, according to the tense of the principal
verb; in fact the sequence varies as in Latin, only that it is a
sequence of mvod and not of tense.</p>

<p>If there is a negative after the ἵνα or ws, it is μή, not οὐ.</p>
<h2 id="ἔφη.">§ 71. ἔφη.</h2>
<p>When a statement is quoted or related, the Greeks use either εἶπεν
ὅτι, or εἶπε with Accusative Infinitive (oratio obliqua).</p>
<p>If the exact words are given (<em>oratio recta</em>), it is common to
use the slightest word, namely, ἔφη, and to put one or two words of the
quoted passage first, and then ἔφη. Thus :—</p>
<ul>
<li>‘Socrates,’ I said, ’are you there? <br />ὦ Σώκρατες, ἔφην, μῶν
πάρει;</li>
<li>And he said ‘Yes, I have been here a long while.’ <br />ὁ δὲ Πάλαι
γάρ, ἔφη, πάρειμι.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="emphatic-position.">§ 72. Emphatic Position.</h2>
<p>In English, a word in a sentence often gets emphasis by the use of
the expression i is, it was, when in Greek (as in Latin) the emphasis
can be quite as clearly and much more neatly given by the position of
the word. Thus :—</p>
<ul>
<li>It was yesterday I came. <br/>ἐχθὲς ἦλθον.</li>
<li>It is you I have been expecting; but it is he who is come. <br />σὲ
μὲν πάλαι προσδοκῶ· οὗτος δὲ ἥκει.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="adverbs-of-place.">§ 73. Adverbs of Place.</h2>
<p>One caution is required in doing Greek composition about Adverbs of
Place.</p>
<p>In English we often use there, here, where, not only after Verbs of
rest, where they are legitimate, but also after Verbs of motion, where
they stand for the more correct thither, hither, whither. In Greek this
license is never allowed, and the learner must be on his guard
therefore.</p>
<ul>
<li>Come here. <br />δεῦρο ἐλθέ (not ἐνθάδε).</li>
<li>He went there. <br />ἤει ἐκεῖσε (not ἐκεῖ).</li>
<li>Where are they gone? <br />ποῖ οἴχονται (not ποῦ);</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="interrogations.">§ 74. Interrogations.</h2>
<p>There are a great variety of ways of asking questions in Greek,
corresponding to the number of Interrogative Particles. The principal
are given below.</p>
<p>(1.) No Particle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Will you come forward? <br />θέλεις παρελθεῖν</li>
<li>Can you help me? <br />δύνασαί μοι ἐπαρκεῖν;</li>
</ul>
<p>(2.) οὐ, οὔκουν, dp’ οὐ, πῶς οὔ (the latter especially used where the
question is impatient or indignant).</p>
<ul>
<li>Shall you not fight? <br />οὐ μαχεῖ;</li>
<li>Are we not then come? <br />οὔκουν ἀφίγμεθα;</li>
<li>Is tt not impudent? <br />πῶς οὐκ ἀναιδές ἐστι;</li>
</ul>
<p>(3.) ἄλλο τι, ἄλλο τι ἤ.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have we not made a mistake? <br />ἄλλο τι ἁμαρτάνομεν;</li>
<li>Do not the dead sleep? <br />ἄλλο τι ἢ οἱ τεθνηκότες
καθεύδουσι;</li>
</ul>
<p>(4.) μῶν, μὴ, ἄρα μή, μῶν μή.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you think we have not said enough? <br />μῶν μή δοκεῖ ἐνδεῶς
λελέχθαι;</li>
<li>Does he do you wrong? <br />μῶν τί σε ἀδικεῖ;</li>
<li>Do we seem to you? <br />μή σοι δοκοῦμεν;</li>
</ul>
<p>(5.) πότερον (alternative questions chiefly; but often in simple
questions, since they can always be put alternatively : Is it so or
not?).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Shall you conquer or not? <br />πότερον νικήσεις αὐτόν, ἡ
OV;</p></li>
<li><p>Will they dispute this? <br />πότερον τοῦτο
ἀμφισβητήσουσι;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Of these, (2) and (3) expect answer ’ yes;’ in (4) answer is negative
or doubtful; in (1) and (5) answer is doubtful.</p>
<p>I have said nothing about interrogatives like ris, πότε, ποῦ, πῶς,
etc., as there is no difficulty with these.</p>
<h2 id="dramatic-particles.">§ 75. Dramatic Particles.</h2>
<p>The Greek being more lively than English, dramatic particles are
often inserted in Greek where in English none are used. Such particles
are δή, apa, and the following instances from the Exercises will
illustrate the difference between the languages :—</p>
<ul>
<li>For this I give thanks. <br />τούτου δὴ χάριν ἔχω.</li>
<li>To know what the others think. <br />εἰδέναι τί ἄρα οἱ ἕτεροι
οἴονται.</li>
<li>Remained as though working. [Appearance put on.] <br />ἔμενον ὡς
ἐργαζόμενοι δὴ.</li>
<li>Wondering how the letter saw. <br />θαυμάσας πῶς ἅρα ἡ ἐπιστολὴ
εἶδεν.</li>
<li>We are in terrible danger. <br />ἐν δεινῷ δὴ κινδύνῳ ἐσμέν.</li>
<li>We are now helpless. <br />ἀμήχανοι δὴ νῦν ἐσμέν.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes they stand in a lively way for a word like alleged,
supposed, in English.</p>
<ul>
<li>He brought in the supposed women. <br />[They were really
conspirators dressed up.] <br />εἰσήγαγε τὰς γυναῖκας δή.</li>
<li>The supposed new cloth. <br />[Really nothing.] <br />τὸ νέον δὴ
ὕφασμα.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="μέν-and-δέ.">§ 76. μέν and δέ.</h2>
<p>When a sentence contains two clauses opposed or antithetic to each
other, it is customary to mark this antithesis clearly in Greek, by
putting μέν with the first and δέ with the second.</p>
<p>In English we do this sometimes by particles :—</p>
<ul>
<li>… indeed … but …,</li>
<li>or,— on the one hand … on the other …;</li>
</ul>
<p>sometimes with only one, or even no particle at all. Thus it is
necessary for the learner to be on his guard, that he may not omit the
μέν and δέ when they are required. Examples :—</p>
<ul>
<li>I indeed am strong, but you are weak. <br />ἐγὼ μὲν ἰσχυρός, σὺ δὲ
ἀσθενής.</li>
<li>On the one hand there is danger if we try; on the other, there is no
hope if we do not try. <br />καὶ πειρωμένοις μὲν κίνδυνός ἐστιν μὴ
πειρωμένοις δὲ οὐδεμία ἐλπίς.</li>
</ul>
<p>[One omitted. ]</p>
<ul>
<li>Before he was happy, but now he is wretched. <br />πρότερον μὲν
εὐτυχὴς ἦν—νῦν δὲ ἄθλιος,</li>
</ul>
<p>[Both omitted. ]</p>
<ul>
<li>The Athenians loved poets; the Spartans did not. <br />οἱ μὲν
Ἀθηναῖοι ἐφίλουν τοὺς ποιητάς· οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι οὔ.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="negatives.">§ 77. Negatives.</h2>
<p>There are two Negatives, οὐ and μή, usually distinguished as οὐ
negative of Statement, μή negative of Conception. The ᾿ definition
becomes intelligible by looking at the usage.</p>
<p>(1.) οὐ, Negative Statement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing happens. <br />οὐδὲν γίγνεται.</li>
<li>I know that no one saw. <br />οἶδα οὐδένα ἰδόντα.</li>
<li>You must not do it. <br />oὐ χρὴ δρᾶν.</li>
<li>Will you not go away? <br />οὐκ ἄπει;</li>
<li>I should not come. <br />οὐκ ἂν ἔλθοιμι.</li>
<li>I asked why it was not done. <br />ἠρόμην τί οὐκ ἐγένετο.</li>
<li>It is not possible that you are not friendly. <br />οὐκ ἔσθ᾽ ὅπως οὐ
φίλος εἶ.</li>
<li>He announced that no one was there. <br />οὐδένα ἤγγειλε παρόντα, or
παρεῖναι.</li>
<li>Though I had nothing I was rich. <br />καίπερ οὐδὲν ἔχων
ἐπλούτουν.</li>
</ul>
<p>(2.) μή, Negative Conception.</p>

<h2 id="any-ever-as-yet-etc.-after-negative.">§ 78. ‘Any,’ ‘ever,’ ‘as
yet,’ etc., after Negative.</h2>
<p>In Greek the idiom of the Negatives differs so far from the idiom in
English, that all the Indefinite words following a negative are also
themselves negative. Thus :—</p>
<ul>
<li>Ι never heard anything anywhere from anybody. <br />οὔποτε ἤκουσα
οὐδὲν οὐδαμοῦ οὐδενός.</li>
</ul>
<p>The words thus used are chiefly the following :—</p>

<p>If μή is required in the first negative, the others will all begin
with μή :—</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t give anything to anybody. <br />μὴ δίδου μηδὲν μηδενί.</li>
</ul>
<p>So ‘even’ after negative becomes in Greek not even, οὐδέ.</p>

<li>No woman even tries.<br />οὐδεμία γυνὴ οὐδὲ πειρᾶται.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="that-in-english.">§ 79. ‘That’ in English.</h2>
<p>For the help of the beginner, it may be useful to tabulate the
various ways in which the word ‘that’ is used, and the corresponding
Greek words or idioms.</p>
<p>(1.) Demonstrative (ἐκεῖνος, or sometimes οὗτος).</p>
<ul>
<li>That man.<br />ἐκεῖνος ὁ ἄνθρωπος.</li>
<li>That is a great pleasure. <br />τοῦτο ἥδιστόν ἐστιν.</li>
</ul>
<p>(2.) Relative (ὅς or ὅσπερ).</p>
<ul>
<li>The man that I saw. <br />ἀνὴρ ὃν εἶδον.</li>
<li>The woman that came. <br />ἡ γυνὴ ἥπερ ἦλθεν.</li>

<p>(3.) Conjunction.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>After verbs of saying or thinking: Accusative (or Nominative) and
Infinitive, § 40.
<ul>
<li>I said that the moon was bright. <br />εἶπον τὴν σελήνην λαμπρὰν

<li>I don’t think that you will come. οὐκ οἴομαι σὲ ἥξειν.</li>

<li>I know that he is here. <br />οἶδα αὐτὸν παρόντα.</li>
<li>I perceive that I am sick. <br /> αἰσθάνομαι νοσῶν.</li>

<p>(Both (a) and (b) can also be done with ὅτι, only be careful about
tenses, § 64.)</p>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li>After verbs of asking, etc.: Infinitive: and Accusative if subject

<h2 id="neither-nor.">§ 80. ‘Neither, nor.’</h2>
<p>The beginner is always puzzled with οὔτε and οὐδέ difference between
them is this :—</p>
<p>When two negative clauses are on the same footing, and you start with
an intention to make both denials, you then use in English <em>Neither …
nor</em>, and in Greek you use <em>οὔτε … οὔτε</em>.</p>
<p>When, however, you begin with one negative clause standing alone, and
then add another, in English you use <em>not . . . nor</em>, and in
Greek <em>οὐκ… οὐδέ</em>.</p>
<p>The same is true of μήτε, μηδέ.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><ul>
<li>Neither cows nor horses. <br />οὔτε βόες οὔτε ἵπποι.</li>
<li>I will neither remain nor depart. <br />οὔτε μενῶ οὔτε ἄπειμι.</li>

<h1 id="exercises.">EXERCISES.</h1>
<p>We will suppose the learner to have mastered the Article <em>ὁ ἡ

<td style="text-align: left;">νόος–νοῦς | ὀστέον—ὀστοῦν</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>with the Attic Declension, as λεώς, ἀνώγεων.</p>
<p>These declensions are the first two in most Grammars; and the
advantage of dividing them thus, and calling them A and O Declensions,
is that the reason of the differences in termination is then so clearly
seen.</p>
<p>With these should be learnt the Adjectives which follow these
declensions, namely, for example—</p>
<ul>
<li><em>σοφός, σοφή, σοφόν</em> | <em>ἴδιος, ἰδία, ἴδιον</em></li>
</ul>
<p>and the contracted forms, χρυσέος, ἀργυρέος (-οῦς).</p>
<p>These really add nothing to the trouble, for they simply follow the
three genders of the Substantive.</p>
<p>Also should be learnt ὅς, ἥ, ὅ, exactly like σοφός (except 6 neuter),
and οὗτος, ὅδε, ἐκεῖνος, τοσοῦτος, τοιοῦτος, and αὐτός, all very like
each other.</p>
<p>Then we are ready to begin our first Exercises.</p>
<p>In order to enable the learner at once to make whole sentences, which
is much less wearisome than doing meaningless fragments, the principal
parts of the verb ‘to be’ are here given, to be used in the
Exercises.</p>

<p>So far we have used none but the A and O Declensions, including not
only the Substantives, but the Adjectives and Pronouns which are
similarly declined.</p>
<p>We now shall add the Consonant Declensions; i.e. we shall use all
Substantives, Adjectives, and Pronouns, without any restriction: and
also Participles, which are similarly declined, though as the Verbs are
not yet learnt, the Nominative Singular of the Participle will be
given.</p>
<p>As to the Verbs, we shall still only assume knowledge of the parts of
εἰμί, to be, given on page 66; and all other verbs required will be
given in the Exercises in the part which is wanted.</p>
<p>The learner will thus be familiarised with some of the common
terminations before definitely learning the Verbs.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the Vocabulary henceforth we shall give the sfem of the
Substantives which belong to the Consonant-declension: so that the
student will have no need to look the word out in grammar or dictionary,
tf he kners his Declensions.</p>
<p>Thus, supposing he wants the Genitive Singular and Dative Plural of
ὄνυξ, he finds in the Vocabulary ὄνυξ (-υχ-): this teaches him that the
sfem is orvy-, and from that he knows that the Genitive Singular is
ὄνυχος, and the Dative Plural ὄνιξι.</p>
<p><em>Obs.</em>—Unless the contrary is stated, Nouns in -ος are
masculine, like λόγος : in -α and -η, fem.: in -ον, neut. Also Nouns in
-ις are feminine.</p>

<p>The Ethiopians, inhabiting a land facing toward the south, consider
water to be most-precious. And in the same land there is a race of apes,
being both otherwise intelligent, and especially clever at finding<a

natural, by the smell, being a long way off. Accordingly the barbarians,
having caught one of the apes, and having tied his leg with a thong,
lead him through the land. And the ape follows willingly for a time<a

And once on a time there was one of the citizens, coarse in his nature,
who being vexed with the Kalydonioi, said that} the daughter of the
principal man among them (of them) was not royal. And she hearing it,<a
href="#fn330" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref330"

prove that (ὅτι) she was (is) royal. And royal persons are easy to
discern in this way, because they must lie softly: otherwise they are
severely wounded and suffer pain in their body. Accordingly she bought a
dry bean and laid it down on a couch, and having spread twenty very soft
rugs over the bean, she lay down.</p>
