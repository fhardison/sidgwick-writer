# PREFACE.

THE object of this little book is to help those who are beginning Greek to learn from the first to write the language as well as read it. There is among many teachers a strong belief (which I am inclined to share) that Greek is mastered much more effectively if a little writing be combined with the reading, even from the earliest stages. The great inferiority of the knowledge of Greek acquired at schools, as compared with Latin, is partly, no doubt, due to the language being harder and begun later, but partly also to the fact that Latin writing is cultivated from the first, while Greek writing is so commonly neglected.

The difficulties of Greek composition fall naturally into three heads, ---difficulties of Accidence, of Syntax, and of Idiom. Speaking broadly, this book is meant to deal chiefly with the first, and so may serve as a first stage (for those who mean to pursue the study) to my Introduction to Greek Prose Composition! which deals with the other two sets of difficulties included under the head of Syntax and Idiom.

In reality, of course, it is neither possible nor desirable that this distinction should be rigidly maintained, as there are questions both of Syntax and Idiom which will-occur in the most elementary composition. Thus, if we take the sentence, 'I used that horse which I had bought,' while it would be difficult to find a more simple one, still it undoubtedly involves two points of Syntax---that χρῶμαι, 'I use,' requires the Dative case, and that ἐκεῖνος, ' that,' requires the Article------and two points of Idiom---that the Relative is attracted (not ὅν, but ᾧ) to the case of the antecedent, and that the Greeks would probably say, not 'had bought,' but 'bought,' so that the whole sentence would be ἐχρησάμην ἐκείνῳ τῷ ἵππῳ, ᾧ ἐπριάμην. Points such as these, which one may call the elements of Syntax and Idiom, will be found treated here with tolerable completeness. Thus the student will learn the use of the Tenses, the use of the Cases, the use of Participles, the use of the Genitive Absolute, all of which belong to the simple sentence, and are really quite easily grasped at an early stage, And I have introduced also from time to time the easier and commoner forms of even the Compound Sentence; the Accusative and Infinitive (familiar from Latin), the use of πρὶν and ὥστε with the Infinitive, the easy rules about ἵνα, and the two simplest cases of ἄν. In this way I have endeavoured to lead the student to the point at which he may take to more advanced books of Greek prose composition, or, if the teacher prefers, may do pieces selected from English narratives.

I have further endeavoured to make the book progressive from the beginning. The first few Exercises require no knowledge, except of the A Declension. After that we advance to the other Declensions, then to the easier Tenses of the Verbs, then the harder Tenses, etc. The same progressive character I have kept, or tried to keep, in introducing the usages; thus the Participial usages begin in Exercise 35, the Genitive Absolute in 50, Construction of 'Knowing' Verbs in 73, 'Final' Clauses in 79, and so on.

The same plan has been adhered to which was adopted in my Greek Prose Composition, of giving all the Exercises in a narrative form. This plan, which is intended to diminish the dulness of doing English into Greek, is even more desirable at the early stages of composition than at the later, inasmuch as the boys are younger, and the Accidence must in any case be great drudgery. It is not at all necessary that anything of value should be sacrificed in adopting this plan, if proper care be taken. The main difficulty, of course, was in the first Exercises, where only a few Substantives and Adjectives are supposed to be known; but this was got over by writing out the three tenses of the verb 'to be,' and, whenever any other verbs were used, giving the part required. Thus from the first the Exercises are more or less connected wholes, and the plan of familiarising the learner with certain common forms of the Verb before he comes to learn them, seemed not only unobjectionable but advantageous.

I have given all the new words used in each Exercise in a Vocabulary at the head of it, and αἰ the words of all the Exercises in the collected Vocabulary at the end. Thus, if the learner remembers the words he had already had, he will want no help but his Accidence and the page before him; if he forgets them, he will simply have to turn to the Vocabulary at the end. In the Vocabularies I have given the stems of the Substantives, and the Genders where doubtful, and, after the Exercises, a list of the Irregular Verbs used in them.

I will only add that I shall be most grateful if those who use the book will kindly point out any errors or omissions which they may detect.

# FIRST GREEK WRITER

# THE ARTICLE.

**§ 1.** The Article *ὀ ἡ τό* gives a good deal of trouble to the learner before its use is fully mastered, and it is best therefore to explain the main points about it at the very first.

There is no word in Greek for *a, an*: it is simply omitted: or the Indefinite Pronoun *τις*, 'a certain one,' is used. The Greek Article means *the*, and it is used (broadly speaking) wherever we use *the*, but also in some places where we do not. It is these latter which constitute the difficulty to the beginner.

## § 2. Position of the Article with Adjectives.

In English we say 'the bad man;' and if we wish to translate this into Greek, the point to observe is that *the adjective must have the article*.

The order of Adjectives and Substantives may be inverted if we please. Thus we may say either *ὁ κακὸς ἀνήρ*, or *ὁ ἀνὴρ ὁ κακός*; but in either case the Adjective must have the Article. ΄

If this rule is broken, as it is often by beginners, and if we write *ὁ ἀνὴρ κακός*, or *κακὸς ὁ ἀνήρ*, the phrase is still good Greek, but the meaning is quite altered; it is no longer 'the bad man,' but 'the man is bad.' The adjective, by being deprived of the article, has ceased to be an attribute, and has become a predicate.

## § 3. The Article with Adjectives.

The Article is sometimes used in English with only an Adjective, the Substantive being understood. This is also a Greek idiom, but is a great deal more frequent than in English, especially in the neuter. Examples :---

- The wise \[men\]. <br/>οἵ σώφρονες.
- The bad-tempered person.  <br/>ὁ δύσκολος,
- The Beautiful \[abstract\]. <br/>τὸ καλόν.
- Troublesome things. <br/>τὰ ἀνιαρά.
- Uncertainty. <br/>τὸ ἀστάθμητον.
- Other people's country. <br/>ἡ ἀλλοτρία.

## § 4. The Article with Adjectives of Position.

One usage must be carefully observed. When the Article is used with adjectives of position, the Adjective comes first, outside the Article. Thus :---

- On the top of the hill. <br/>ἐπ᾿ ἀκροῦ τοῦ λόφου.
- In the middle of the road. <br/>ἐν μέσῃ τῇ ὁδῷ.

So with πᾶς, as often in English :---

- All the men. <br/>πάντες οἱ ἄνθρωποι.
- All night long. <br/>πᾶσαν τὴν νύκτα.

## § 5. The Article with Participles.

Just as we have seen above in the case of the Adjective, so in English we can in a few cases use the Article with Participles (whether the Substantive is expressed or only understood does not matter); such as the following :---' The living,' 'the dead,' 'the defeated cavalry,' 'the coming man,' 'the insufficiently apprehended truth,' etc. In Greek there is no limit to this use. The following are a few examples :---.

- The cause of what occurred. <br/>ἡ αἰτία τοῦ γενομένον.
- The events which have happened. <br/>τὰ γεγενημένα.
- The survivors. <br/>οἱ περιγενόμενοι.
- Expediency, duty, etc. <br/>τὸ συμφέρον, τὸ δέον, etc.
- The thing asked for. <br/>τὸ αἰτούμενον.

And so with longer phrases :---

- The men who took: their share in this perilous undertaking. οἱ τοῦδε τοῦ κινδύνου ξυναράμενοι ἄνδρες.
- All the actions done by me for the good of the city πάντα τὰ ἐμοὶ ἐπ᾽ ἀγαθῷ τῆς πόλεως πεπραγμένα.

Constantly, therefore, when in English we have a relative sentence with a verb, in Greek we have simply a phrase (coupled to the noun) with Article and Participle.

## § 6. The Article with Adverbial Clauses, etc.

Another very natural extension of the use of the Article in Greek is the following :---Instead of saying, as we might by § 5, οἵ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως ἐλθόντες, 'the people who had come out of the city,' since the sense is quite clear without the Participle, we can often say simply---οἱ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως, 'the people from the city.'

So a vast number of convenient phrases :---

- The bean that was below. <br/>ὁ κύαμος ὁ κάτωθεν.
- Those who were there. <br/>οἱ ἐκεῖ,
- The things of old. <br/>τὰ πάλαι.
- What happened afterwards. <br/>τὰ ἐνθένδε, or τὰ ἔπειτα.
- The camp on the mountain. <br/>τὸ στρατόπεδον τὸ ἐπὶ τοῦ ὄρους.

**§ 7.** Observe: it is very important for turning into Greek to notice whether such a clause as those given above belongs to the Substantive or not. On this will depend whether we have to put the Article or not.

Thus, compare the two sentences---

1. I killed the stranger from Corinth.
1. I killed the stranger in the street.

It is clear that in (1) 'from Corinth' belongs to the 'stranger;' while in (2) 'in the street' belongs not to 'stranger, but to the verb. In English, the sense only is our guide, not the structure. In Greek we know at once what is meant from the use of the Article.

Thus (1) is

- τὸν ξένον τὸν ἀπὸ Κορίνθου ἔκτεινα,

and (2) is

- τὸν ξένον ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ἔκτεινα.

Again, in some cases *exactly the same phrase* may either require the Article or not, according to circumstances. It depends on the principle above enunciated, namely, that the adverbial phrase without the Article belongs to the Verb, with the Article to the Substantive. Thus :---

- I conceived a suspicion about him. <br/>ὑποψίαν ἔλαβον περὶ αὐτοῦ.
- I went away from suspicion about him. <br/>ἀπῆλθον ὑποψίᾳ τῇ περὶ αὐτοῦ.

## § 8. The Article with the Infinitive.

The neuter Article τό is also very conveniently used with the Infinitive, where we use the gerund-form or verbal substantive in -ing. Thus :---

- Singing is difficult. <br/>τὸ ᾄδειν χαλεπόν ἐστι.
- Many things are done by trying. <br/>πολλὰ τῷ πειρᾶσθαι περαίνεται.
- Skilled in shooting. <br/>ἔμπειρος τοῦ τοξεύειν.

Or, if there is a subject to the Verb, the Accusative and Infinitive is used, as might be expected :---

- We were beaten owing to our allies running away. <br/>ἐνικήθημεν διὰ τὸ \[τοὺς ξυμμάχους ἀποδρᾶναι\].
- That the invaders have been worsted is a great gain. <br/>τὸ \[τοὺς ἐςβαλόντας ἡσσῆσθαι\] μέγα κέρδος ἐστίν.

## § 9. The Article with Demonstratives:

Another point about the Article is its use with Demonstratives, which differs from the English usage, and therefore is important to observe.

Whenever 'this' or 'that' comes in English with a Substantive, the Article must come in the Greek with the Substantive, though the ' this' or 'that' may be either before after the Substantive.^[As it is *never wrong*, and nearly always *necessary*, it has been thought better to put the rule absolutely. When the learner is a good deal more advanced, he will come to understand the few cases in Prose where the Article may be omitted.] Thus :---

- This word. <br/>οὗτος ὁ λόγος, οr ὁ λόγος οὗτος:
- Those enemies. <br/>ἐκεῖνοι οἱ πολέμιοι, or οἱ πολέμιοι ἐκεῖνοι.

The same is true of ὅδε,

## § 10. The Article with Substantives.

There are even with Substantives some cases where the English use of the differs from the Greek. Some of these are too subtle to be worth troubling about at an early stage: they will be learnt after. But some are quite easy, such as the following cases, where in English the Article is omitted, but in Greek is inserted ----

(a.) Class names (often).

- Men are strong: women are weak, <br/>οἱ μὲν ἄνδρες ἰσχυροί, ἀσθενεῖς δὲ αἱ γυναῖκες.
- Greeks are often philosophers. <br/> Ἕλληνες πολλάκις φιλόσοφοί εἰσι.
- Large fish are easily caught. <br/>ῥᾳδίως ἁλίσκονται αἱ μακραὶ ἰχθύες.
- Ears are more beautiful than tails. <br/>τὰ ὦτα καλλίω τῶν κέρκων.

(b.) Abstract.

- Truth is hard to find. <br/>χαλεπὴ εὑρεῖν ἡ ἀλήθεια.
- You are superior in piety. <br/>τῇ εὐσεβείᾳ κρείσσων εἶ.

# NEUTER PLURAL.

**§ 11.** In Greek a Neuter Plural Noun requires the Singular Verb. Thus :---

- These things are so. <br/>ταῦτα οὕτως ἐστίν.
- The trees are tall. <br/>τὰ δένδρα ἐστὶ μακρά.
- I will tell you what happened. <br/>λέξω ἅπερ ἐγένετο.

# PRONOUNS.

## § 12. The Personal Pronouns.

The Personal Pronouns are used just as they are in English, for the most part: the exceptions being the following :---

## (1.) Often omitted with Verbs.

Since the Verbs in Greek by their terminations show what person (1st, 2d, or 3d Singular or Plural) is the Nominative to them (just as is the case in Latin, but mostly not the case in English), it is clear that the Personal Pronouns in the Nominative may be frequently omitted. In fact they will only be put in when there is any emphasis upon them, or otherwise need of them for clearness. Thus :---

- I went down to the city. <br/>κατέβην εἰς τὴν πόλιν.
- He ordered me to stop. <br/>ἐκέλευσέ με μεῖναι.
- You think rightly. <br/>καλῶς δοξάζετε.
- We will talk to one another. <br/>διαλεξόμεθα ἀλλήλοις.

## § 13. (2.) Inserted when Emphatic.

On the other hand, if there is any stress upon the person, the Pronoun must of course be put in, as---

- The rest were away, but you were there. <br/>οἱ μὲν ἄλλοι ἀπῆσαν, σὺ δὲ παρῆσθα.

This will naturally be done when in a narrative a new sentence begins with a new Nominative or subject. Thus :---

- They came to me and asked me to go with them. But I replied that I would not consent. <br/>καὶ οἵ μὲν ἦλθον πρὸς ἐμέ, καὶ ᾔτησαν συνέπεσθαι αὑτοῖς. ἐγὼ δὲ οὐκ ἔφην πείσεσθαι.

## § 14. (3.) The Third Personal Pronoun.

The Third Person in Greek requires a little care. The fact is, that while there is a Greek word for the Genitive, Dative, and Accusative of the Third Person, there is no proper Greek word for the Nominative (he, she, it, they) except with the particles μὲν and δὲ, which can only occur at the beginning of a sentence or clause. This is simply due to the fact that it is not wanted. Let us consider the various cases where he (etc.) is used in English.

(a.) Where there is no emphasis or stress on the person, and it is quite clear who is meant, there is no need in Greek of a Pronoun at all. See § 12.

- And having said this, hé died. <br/>καὶ ταῦτα εἰπὼν ἐτελεύτησε.
- He collected his army, and went off. <br/>συλλέξας τὸ στράτευμα ἀπῴχετο.

(b.) At the beginning of clauses or new sentences in narrative, where the Pronouns are required for clearness, ὁ μέν and ὁ δέ can be used. It should be mentioned that μὲν is not used except with a δὲ clause corresponding and following after it. Thus :---

- And they departed, but she stayed. <br/>καὶ οἱ μὲν ἀπῆλθον, ἡ δὲ ἔμεινεν.
- He feasted, but I slept. <br/>ὁ μὲν ὁὖν ἐδείπνει, ἐγὼ δὲ καθηῦδον.
- And when Cinadon was brought up, the Ephors asked him about the matter. And he replied... <br/>ὡς δὲ ἀνήχθη ὁ Κινάδων, ἤροντο αὐτὸν ot ἔφοροι περὶ τοῦ πράγματος. ὃ δὲ ἀπεκρίνατο. ..

(c.) When the he (etc.) is emphatic, then οὗτος or ἐκεῖνος, the Demonstratives, are used.

- He at least will not flee. <br/>οὔποτε ἐκεῖνός ye φεύξεται.
- They allowed their enemies to live, and shall we kill them? <br/>ἐκεῖνοι μεν τοὺς πολεμίους εἴων ζῆν, ἡμεῖς δὲ ἀποκτενοῦμεν;
- It is strange if he shall do it. <br/>δεινὸν εἰ οὗτός γε δράσει.

## § 15. Oblique Cases.

Thus much about the Nominative of the Third Personal Pronoun. The Oblique Cases are simple: for whenever a word is required at all (which is less often than in English), the oblique cases of atrés are used. A few instinces will suffice :---

- They killed him. <br/>ἀπέκτειναν αὐτόν.
- Ι gave it her. <br/>ἔδωκα αὐτῇ.
- I drank it. <br/>ἔπιον, or ἔπιον αὐτό,
- He cut off their heads. <br/>ἀπέταμον τὰς κεφαλὰς αὑτῶν.

When to use it and when to omit it, the learner can only find out by practice; but he is certain at first to put it in a great deal too often, since the Pronoun is commoner in English than in Greek.

## § 16. αὔτός.

αὐτός is a puzzling word for the beginner, owing to its various uses, for 'self,' 'him,' and 'the same.' It is necessary for him to go fully into the matter, and constantly refer to the explanation and examples, until he is familiar with them.

(1.) 'The same' is always ὁ αὐτός; the Article coming before αὐτός, Thus :---

- The same man. <br/>ὁ αὐτὸς ἀνήρ.
- Of the same woman. <br/>τῆς αὐτῆς γυναικός.

(2.) 'Self' (if it is not reflexive) is αὐτός without the Article before it. Thus :---

- He himself said it. <br/>αὐτὸς εἶπεν.
- These men themselves were killed. <br/>οὗτοι οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοὶ ἀπέθανον.
- At their own request he came. \[i.e. themselves asking. \] <br/>αὐτῶν ἀξιούντων ἦλθεν.
- The wall of the city itself. <br/>τὸ τεῖχος αὐτῆς τῆς πόλεως.
- He said he himself had done it. <br/>ἔφη αὐτὸς δεδρακέναι.
- It is needful for you to go yourself there. <br/>ἀνάγκη σὲ ἐκεῖσε αὐτὸν ἐλθεῖν (not σεαυτόν).
- I must do it myself.ἐμὲ <br/>δεῖ αὐτὸν ποιεῖν (not ἐμαυτόν).

(3.) If i is reflexive \[1.e. if it refers to the same person as the subject to the verb, and is in an oblique case, and is not a subject itself\] use ἑαυτοῦ (ἐμαυτοῦ, σεαυτοῦ), or the less formal οὗ, οὗ, ἔ; and in plural, σφῶν, or σφῶν αὐτῶν, or ἑαυτῶν (ἡμῶν αὐτῶν, ὑμῶν αὐτῶν). Thus :---

- He went to his own home. <br/>πρὸς τὸν ἑαυτοῦ οἶκον ἀπῄει.
- They replied to themselves. <br/>ἀντεῖπον ἑαυτοῖς, or σφίσιν αὐτοῖς.
- Know thyself. <br/>γνῶθι σεαυτόν.
- Ι will kill myself. <br/>ἀποκτενῶ ἐμαυτόν.
- We fear lest it be bad for ourselves. <br/>φοβούμεθα μὴ ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς κακὸν ᾖ.

(4.) αὐτός in the oblique cases is also used for the cases of 'he,' 'she,' 'it,' 'they,' as we have seen above in treating of the Pronouns, § 15.

## § 17. 'Him' Reflexive.

Note 1.---It should be, however, observed, that in English we do not always say 'himself,' but often simply 'him' ('her,' 'it,' etc.), even where the Pronoun is really reflexive.

Thus :---

- They knew he was hostile to them. \[them is reflexive = themselves. \] <br/>ᾔδεσαν αὐτὸν σφίσιν ἐχθρὸν ὄντα.
- He said tt was his cloak. \[his = of himself. \] <br/>ἔφη ἑαυτοῦ εἶναι τὸ ἱμάτιον.
- He took τὲ away with him. <br/>ἀπέφερε μεθ' ἑαυτοῦ.

## § 18. Article to express ' His.'

Note 2.---Often again, where in English 'his,' etc., is used reflexive, and where' we ,might say in Greek 'of himself,' ἑαυτοῦ, it is enough, if no stress is laid on the Pronoun, to use the Article simply. Thus :---

- He hurt his head. <br/>τὴν κεφάλην ἐτραυμάτισε.

See fuller explanation in § 21.

## § 19. 'It' in English.

The beginner should be cautioned about the use of the English 'it,' a Pronoun which stands for every inanimate Substantive and most animals. In Greek, on the contrary, the Pronoun has naturally to be of the gender of the Noun for which it stands.

- He left the gold, for he knew it \[χρυσὸς, Masculine\] would be safe. <br/>... τοῦτον ἀσφαλῆ ἐσόμενον.

- The dove approached : he pulled it in \[περιστερὰ, Feminine\]. <br/>... εἰςήγαγεν αὐτήν.

# § 20. Possessive.

With the exception treated below, the Possessive Pronouns are used pretty much as in English. It is only necessary to mention that there is no Possessive for the third person, and accordingly the Genitive of the Personal Pronoun is used instead, αὐτοῦ, αὐτῆς, αὐτῶν, or, if reflexive, ἑαυτοῦ, ἑαυτῆς, ἑαυτῶν. The others are ἐμός (mine), σός (thine), ὑμέτερος (yours), ἡμέτερος (ours). Thus :----

- He took my shield. <br/>τὴν ἐμὴν ἀσπίδα ἔλαβε.
- He ts your father. <br/>σὸς πάτηρ ἐστί.
- He slew their wives. <br/>τὰς γυναῖκας αὐτῶν ἀπέκτεινε,
- They died by their own hand. <br/>τῇ ἑαυτῶν χειρὶ ἀπέθανον.

Observe that the Article is used with the Possessives (ἐμός, σός, etc.), except where the Substantive with the Possessive is a predicate, i.e. comes after the verb 'to be.'

**§ 21.** Note.---The exception alluded to above is this. In English the Possessive occurs much oftener than in Greek : it is used with no emphasis at all, where there could be no doubt (if it were omitted) whose the thing was. In such a case as that, it is usual in Greek to employ the Article only.

For example---

- They took up their arms and retreated,

\[Here there is no emphasis on 'their': if nothing was said as to whose arms, you would naturally assume they took their own : and accordingly in Greek it would be more usual to say 'the arms.'\]

- τὰ ὅπλα λαβόντες ἀπεχώρουν.

Other instances are the following, which will not need comment :---

- Come with your wife. <br/>ἐλθὲ μετὰ τῆς γυναικός.
- They defend their country. <br/>τῇ πόλει βοηθοῦσι.
- He prospered all his life. <br/>πάντα τὸν βίον εὐτύχει.
  We shall finish our task. <br/>τὸ ἔργον περανοῦμεν.

Common sense will settle, in more complicated sentences, whether the Article or the Possessive is best. Thus :---

- He sent his slave to their house. <br/>ἔπεμψε τὸν δοῦλον πρὸς τὴν ἐκείνων οἰκίαν.
- They sent their slave to thetr house. <br/>ἔπεμψαν τὸν δοῦλον πρὸς τὴν οἰκίαν.

Because in the second the persons concerned are the same all through; in the first they are changed.

## § 22. ἄλλος, ἄλλοτε, etc.

Two idiomatic uses of ἄλλος and its compounds are to be noticed.

(1.) When two are opposed, corresponding to the English use of some ... others.

- Some were rich, others poor. <br/>ἄλλοι μὲν πλούσιοι ἦσαν, ἄλλοι δὲ πένητες.
- Sometimes I ate: at other times I fasted. <br/>ἄλλοτε μὲν ἤσθιον, ἄλλοτε δὲ ἐπείνων.

(2.) When we wish to use the word in a distributive sense, i.e. when we describe an indefinite number of divergent acts, courses, qualities, etc. In English we either repeat the word different, as 'different people went different ways,' or use a complex though accurate form of sentence, as follows :---' One person went one way and another another.' In Greek this is done more neatly by an idiomatic use of ἄλλος.

- One went one way and another another. <br/>ἄλλοι ἄλλῃ ἀπῆλθον.
- Different things are thought beautiful in different places.<br/>ἄλλα ἀλλαχοῦ καλά.
- Different courses pleased different people at different times. <br/>ἄλλοις ἄλλοτε ἄλλα ἐδόκει.

## § 23. οὗτος and ὅδε.

ὅδε is chiefly used in prose for ' the following :' otherwise it is used only by a speaker. Accordingly, when you say 'this,' meaning what is coming, you use in Greek ὅδε (or similar compounds, τοιόςδε, τοσόςδε, τηλικόςδε) : when you say 'this,' meaning what has gone before, you must employ οὗτος (or similar compounds, τοιοῦτος, τοσοῦτος, etc.). Thus :---

- He spoke as follous. <br/>τοιάδε ἔλεξε.
- Having thus spoken. <br/>τοιαῦτα λέξας.
- On these terms (viz., on such terms as I have said). <br/>ἐπὶ τούτοις.

## § 24. τοιοῦτος.

τοιοῦτος is often used in Greek where in English another adjective might occur, especially where the sense of the adjective has been given before, or where τοσοῦτος is used with it.

- So many and so soft rugs. <br/>τοσοῦτοι καὶ τοιοῦτοι τάπητες.
- The island is barren, it is difficult to live in so unproductive a land. <br/>ἐρήμη ἡ νῆσος, ὥστε ἐν τοιαύτῃ γῇ οὐ ῥᾴδιον ζῆν.

## § 25. Relative and Interrogative.

The learner is puzzled at first often by the English word what, owing to its being both relative \[= 'that which'\], and interrogative \[ = 'what?' \].

The best rule is to stop and think whether the sentence remains the same in meaning after substituting 'that which' for 'what.' If so, a Relative is required. Otherwise it will be an Interrogative. \[Sometimes either will make sense, and then it clearly does not matter. \]

1. Interrogative.
   - I investigated what was going on. <br/>ἐσκόπουν τί γίγνεται.
   - No one could tell me what was the cause. <br/>οὐδεὶς ἤδει τί εἴη τὸ αἴτιον.
1. Relative.
   - He laughed at what I had done. <br/>κατεγέλα ὧν ἔδρασα.
   - What he did yesterday delights all. <br/>πάντες ἥδονται ἐφ᾽ οἷς ἐχθὲς ἐποίησεν.

The relative 'what' may also be done with Article and Participle. See § 5.

- The cause of what happens. <br/>τὸ αἴτιον τοῦ γιγνομένου.
- The proceeds of what has been sold. <br/>ἡ πρόσοδος τῶν πεπραμένων.

## § 26. Attraction.

When the Gender, Case, Mood, etc., of one word of a sentence is altered from what it would naturally be to suit the Gender, Case, Mood, etc., of some other word or words, such alteration is said to be due to attraction.

There are many forms of attraction in Greek, the commonest being the attraction of the Relative.

## § 27. Relative Attracted.

(1.) When the antecedent is in the Genitive or Dative, and the Relative would naturally be in Accusative, Attraction often takes place, i.e. the Relative may be put into the same case as the Antecedent.

- None of the friends I have. <br/>οὐδεὶς τῶν φίλων ὧν ἔχω (for οὓς).
- I am pleased with the horse I keep. <br/>τῳ ἵππῷ ᾧ τρέφω ἥδομαι (for ὃν).

(2.) This is still more frequent and idiomatic when the Antecedent is 'a mere Pronoun, which can be omitted. See § 25 (2).

- I abide by what I have sworn. <br/>ἐμμένω οἷς ὤμοσα.
- I thank you for what you promised. <br/>χάριν ἔχω σοὶ ὧν ὑπέσχου.

## § 28. Attraction of the Subject.

When the Subject is a Pronoun (this, that, etc.), and the Predicate a Substantive, the Subject is commonly attracted in Greek into the gender of the Predicate. Thus in English, if we were to say, 'this is a stone,' we should have no difficulty, as there are no genders concerned; but in translating into Greek we should perhaps at first be disposed to put 'this' neuter, meaning 'this thing.' The Greek idiom, however, is to make the gender of 'this' agree by attraction with the gender of 'stone.' Examples :---

- This is a stone. <br/>οὗτός ἐστι λίθος.
- That was a dire calamity. <br/>ἐκείνη ἦν δεινὴ συμφορά.
- What is this disease? <br/>τίς ἐστὶν αὕτη ἡ νόσος.

## § 29. Use of ἕκαστος and éxdaTépos,

The Distributive Pronouns ἑκάτερος and ἕκαστος have a special usage which arises from the nature of the word. A Plural Nominative is, so to speak, distributed into its component parts, and thus grammatically ἕκαστος appears in apposition with a plural. And as in Latin suus and quisque have a tendency to be close together, so in Greek ἕκαστος and ἑαυτοῦ. Thus :---

- They went each to his own house. <br/>ἦλθον εἰς τὸν ἑαυτοῦ ἕκαστος οἶκον.
- The women were doing each thew own work. <br/>αἱ γυναῖκες τὸ αὑτῆς ἑκάστη ἔργον εἰργάζοντο.

If the sentence is of any length (or even sometimes in short sentences), the Verb is singular to agree with ἕκαστος.

## § 30. Use of Neuter Adjective.

Just as in the case of the Article we have seen that the Adjective is used with Article in the neuter, where in English generally some Substantive is employed, so frequently the Adjective (or Pronoun) is used in the neuter (whether with or without Article), where in English Substantives are required. This is especially the case where the Substantive is of kindred meaning (cognate) with the Verb.

- He suffered terrible treatment. <br/>δεινὰ ἔπαθε,
- They tell strange tales. <br/>θαυμάσια μυθολογοῦσι.
- He made the following reply. <br/>τοιάδε ἀπεκρίνατο.

## § 31. Predicative Adjective.

We have seen that if the Adjective has not the Article and the Substantive has, the Adjective is used with a predicative meaning, as---

- The man is bad. <br/>κακὸς ὁ ἀνήρ.

This is obvious enough in the Nominative; but in Greek this predicative use of the Adjective without Article is extended also to other cases (known as Tertiary Predicate).

- The house you have is large. <br/>μεγάλην τὴν οἰκίαν ἔχεις.
- Great was the enthusiasm with which we followed him <br/>πολλῇ τῇ προθυμίᾳ συνειπόμεθα αὐτῷ.
- Splendid was the city he ruled. <br/>ἰσχυρᾶς τῆς πόλεως ἦρχε.

So where in English the predicative form is not used: often in speaking of qualities or parts of the body :---

- He had large ears. <br/>μεγάλα εἶχε τὰ ὦτα.
- I have a rough temper. <br/>τραχεῖαν ἔχω τὴν ὀργήν.
- He looked with unflinching eyes. <br/>ὀρθοῖς τοῖς ὄμμασιν ἔβλεψε.

So again, where the adjective describes rather the result of the action (proleptic), which in English may be expressed variously :---

- Raising his voice he spoke. <br/>μεγάλῃ τῇ φωνῇ εἶπε. <br/>(With the voice high.)
- Composing his face toa solemn look. <br/>σεμνὴν διαθεὶς τῆν ὄψιν. <br/>(Composing his face solemn.)

## § 32. δῆλος and φανερός.

There is a special idiom in the construction οὗ δῆλος and φανερός, also due to attraction. See ὃ 26.

In English we say, 'It is evident that you are ill;' 'that-you-are-ill' being logically the subject of the verb 'is-evident.' In Greek, however, the person is made the subject, and the sentence becomes 'You are evident being ill,' or δῆλος εἶ νοσῶν, In the following examples the English is purposely varied :----

- It became clear that she was mad. <br/>φανερὰ ἐγένετο μαινομένη.
  -You will be proved to have erred. <br/>δῆλοι γενήσεσθε ἁμαρτόντες.
- It was evident they would die. <br/>φανεροὶ ἦσαν θανούμενοι.
- I saw the enemy had failed. <br/>δῆλός μοι ἦν σφαλεὶς ὁ πολέμιος.

## § 33. πολύς and μέγας.

When 'many' is used with another adjective, in Greek --- often καὶ is inserted between the two: we say in English 'many wonderful laws;' in Greek they say 'many and wonderful.' As---

- Many strange marvels. <br/>πολλὰ καὶ δεινὰ θαύματα.
- Many clever things were said. <br/>πολλὰ καὶ σοφὰ ἐλέγετο.

So again with the adjective 'great' :---

- A great fat man. <br/>ἀνήρ μέγας καὶ παχύς.
- A large black chest. <br/>μεγάλη καὶ μέλαινα θήκη.

# THE CASES.

**§ 34.** The use of the Cases will be best learnt by degrees, through the process of finding what each word governs, and so fixing the general principles in the mind. But it may be of some use to the learner to give a few general hints about them, to which he can refer from time to time.

## The Nominative.

The Nominative is used exactly as in English, or any other language, as the subject of the verb. No rule is required.

After Passives, Substantive Verbs, etc., it is used exactly as in Latin. Thus :---

- He is good. <br />οὗτός ἐστιν ἀγαθός.
- She is trying to be thought beautiful. <br />πειρᾶται καλὴ νομίζεσθαι,
- We are called just. <br />δίκαιοι καλούμεθα.

In one use only does Greek differ from other inflected languages with regard to the Nominative, and that is in what is called the Nominative Attraction. When in a clause of oratio obliqua the subject is the same as that of the principal verb, it is Nominative and not (as in Latin) Accusative. Thus :---

- I say that you are good. <br />φημί σε ἀγαθὸν εἶναι.
- I say that I am good. <br />φημὶ ἀγαθὸς εἶναι.

So with Participles ---

- I know that you are good. <br />οἶδά σε ἀγαθὸν ὄντα.
- I know that I am good. <br />οἶδα ἀγαθὸς ὤν.

For the principle which determines whether Infinitive or Participle is to be used, see below, § 40.

## § 35. Genitive Case.

To understand fully all the uses of the Genitive case requires a long and difficult study, which it would be out of place to 'pursue here, but the learner may be helped even in the early stages by noticing the main usages,

(a.) Genitive of aim.

- To shoot at a mark. <br />τοξεύειν σκοποῦ. <br />(So στοχάζομαι, ἐφίεσθαι, etc.)
- Go home-wards. <br />ἐπ' οἴκου ἰέναι.

On this principle most verbs of aiming at, feeling after, desiring, perceiving (taste, smell, touch, listen to), etc., have the Genitive.

Such also is the special use of τοῦ μὴ to express the object of a verb or act :---

- They ran, with the aim of not being caught. <br />ἀπέδραμον τοῦ μὴ ἁλῶναι.

(b.) Connected with this is the Genitive of respect or reference, a large class: the English uses corresponding are very various, being rendered by the prepositions 'in regard to,' 'in respect of,' 'for,' 'in,' and very commonly 'of.' It describes the point *in which* the Verb or Adjective employed is applicable.

- Skilled in the art. <br />ἐπιστήμων τῆς τέχνης.
- Enviable for wisdom. <br />ζηλωτὸς τῆς σοφίας.

So with many words describing 'emptiness' or 'fulness,' as πένεσθαι, πλουτεῖν, πληρὴς, κενός, δεῖ, ἐνδεής, δεῖσθαι, πίμπλασθαι, γέμειν, etc.

So special idioms, like

- Having broken his head. <br />κατεαγὼς τῆς κεφαλῆς. \[lit. being broken in respect of . . .\]

So also after many words which in English are transitive, and take Accusative, but in Greek are intransitive, and take Genitive to describe the thing or respect in which the Verb applies.

Such words are φείδομαι (spare), κρατεῖν (govern), ἔχεσθαι (clasp), λανθάνομαι (forget), ἀμελεῖν (neglect), ἐπιμελεῖσθαι (nanage).

The Adjectives and Substantives corresponding to such words will naturally govern the same case.

- Neglect of this. <br />ἀμέλεια τούτου.
- To have care for mankind. <br />ἐπιμέλειαν τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἔχειν.

So Prepositions describing local relation :---

- ὑπό, literally beneath of, beneath as regards, and so simply under.
- ἐπί, upon.
- περί, about, around.
- ὑπέρ, above.
- πρό, before.
- πρός, in front of, on the side of.
- πέρα, beyond.
- διά, through, and metaphorically by means of.
- ἀντί, in front af.

(c.) Connected with this again are a variety of usages expressing relations between Substantives, such as are in Latin already familiar as rendered by Genitive, and in English are given mostly by ' of.'

Examples of the leading kinds under this head :---

- The father of the man. <br />ὁ πατὴρ τοῦ ἀνδρός (Possessive).
- Wall of eight furlongs. <br />ὀκτὼ σταδίων τεῖχος (Descriptive).
- The most of the soldiers. <br /> οἱ πολλοὶ τῶν στρατιωτῶν (Partitive).

So with Verbs describing partition, as μετέχειν (shure), μεταλαβεῖν (partake of), συμβάλλομαι (contribute to).

(d.) The Genitive is used after Comparatives, where we use 'than."[^1] Here it corresponds to Latin ablative. Example :---

- He is better than his father. <br />ἀμείνων ἐστι τοῦ πατρός.

(e.) The Genitive is used (like the Latin ablative) to express separation or motion 'from.'

- To retire from the walls. <br />τῶν τειχῶν ἀποχωρεῖν.

So with words meaning 'to cease from,' 'to change from,' 'to keep aloof from,' etc., ἀπὸ στερεῖν (to deprive), ἁμαρτάνειν (to miss): and all prepositions meaning 'from,' or ' without,' or 'out of,' ἀπό, ἄνευ, δίχα, ἐκ, πρός (at hands of), παρά (from side of).

So also *origin*.

- Born of a wise mother. <br />μητρὸς σοφῆς γεγονώς.

(4) Of Time.---The Genitive is used to express the time within which... | |

- In the night. <br />νυκτός.
- Within three days. <br />τριῶν ἡμερῶν.

And after a Negative it corresponds to English for.

- For twenty years I never went away. <br />εἰκόσιν ἐτῶν οὐδέποτε ἀπεδήμησα.
- For two months I earned nothing. <br />δυοῖν μηνοῖν οὐδένα μισθὸν ἔλαβον.

So

- Once a year (really partitive). <br />ἅπαξ τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ.

(g.) With a Participle, as Genitive absolute.

- While the sun was setting. <br />δύοντος τοῦ ἡλίου.
- As they had not come. <br />τούτων οὐκ ἀφικομένων.
- If no one aids. <br />μηδενὸς ἐπαρκοῦντος.

(h.) Of Price.

- How much is this sold for? <br />πόσου τάδε πωλεῖται;

- I have not the wherewithal to buy it. <br />οὐκ ἔχω οὖ ὠνήσομαι.

These are the main heads: but the details of the special usages of the Genitive, what Verbs and Prepositions govern it, must be learnt by slowly gathored experience.

## § 36. Accusative.

(a.) The common use, as the object of Transitive Verbs.

- I killed him. <br /> ἔκτεινα αὐτόν.

This is so familiar from Latin and other languages that no more need be said.. So Prepositions of motion to, πρός, ἐς. παρά (to beside), ἐπί (like English ' on to'), ὑπό (to under).

(b.) To express extent of space or time (like Latin).

- I was ill for three days. <br />τρεῖς ἡμέρας ἐνόσουν.
- It is five furlongs off. <br />πέντε σταδίους ἀπέχει.

So, Prepositions which have notion of movement along :--- παρὰ, alongside of, and metaphorically aside of, contrary to. κατὰ, down along, and metaphorically according to, opposite to. ἀνὰ, up along, and metaphorically according w. περὶ, round along, and metaphorically concerned with.

(c.) Cognate (like Latin).

- He went his own way. <br />τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ὁδὸν ἀπῆλθε.

So, without substantive :---

- He sinned many sins. <br />πολλὰ ἥμαρτε.
- He inflicted no injury on me. <br />οὐδὲν ἐμὲ ἠδίκει.

(d.) Respect (also like Latin).

- I have a headache. <br />ἀλγῶ τὴν κεφαλήν.
- Royal in race. <br />βασιλικὸς τὸ γένος.
- Superior to Corinth in size. <br />κρείσσων τῆς Κορίνθου τὸ μέγεθος.

It will be observed with regard to this last usage that the Dative is used in a very similar way; and in many cases either would do to express the sense equally well.

## § 37. Dative.

(a.) Time: 'at,' or 'on.'

- On that night. <br />ἐκείνῃ τῇ νυκτὶ.
- On the next day. <br />τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ.
- In the former year. <br />τῷ προτέρῳ ἐνιαυτῷ.
- To-morrow. <br />τῇ αὐρίον.

Somewhat similar are *ἐν τούτῳ, ἐν ᾧ, meanwhile, whilst.*

(6.) After ordinary Verbs, of person or things affected, like English 'to,' and Latin Dative.

- I give it to him. <br />δίδωμι αὐτῷ.
- He was slave to the king. <br />τῷ βασιλεῖ ἐδούλευε.

Also (like Genitive) with Verbs which in English are transitive, where in Greek the Dative describes the person affected.

- I aided you. <br />ἐπήρκεσα ὑμῖν (so ἀμύνειν, βοηθεῖν).
- We served him. <br />ὑπηρετοῦμεν αὐτῷ.

(c.) Ethic: of person affected, where, however, the sentence is grammatically complete without it.

- Climb the ladder I pray. <br />ἀνάβαινέ μοι τὴν κλίμακα.
- Who of your friends is dead? <br />τίς τέθνηκέ σοι;

This usage also familiar in Latin.

(d.) Of the instrument, after any Verb or Adjective.

- He strikes me with his hand. <br />παίει με τῇ χειρί.
- Stiff with cold. <br />ψύχει στερρός.
- He frightened him urth his insolence. <br />ἐξέπληξεν αὐτὸν τῇ ὕβρει.
- Hot with anger. <br />ὀργῇ θερμὸς.
- He died of hunger. <br />λιμῷ ἀπώλετο.
- Demoralised by wealth. <br />πλούτῳ μαλακισθείς.

(e.) Of the manner.

- He found it in a strange way. <br />θαυμασίῳ τρόπῳ ἐξεῦρε.
- He helped me with great zeal. <br />πολλῃ προθυμίᾳ ἐβοήθει μοι.

(f.) Often of the ' point in which,' or 'respect.'

- Inferior in strength. <br />φαῦλος τῇ δυνάμει.
- A man, Snooks by name. <br />ἀνὴρ ὀνόματι Σνῶξ.

So ἔργῳ, λόγῳ, γνώῤῃ, ἴσχνι, προφάσει, etc.

(g.) So again, as in Latin and English, of nearness and likeness, etc., after such words as

- ὅμοιος, ἔοικε, εἰκάζω, ὁ αὐτός, παραπλήσιος, ἐναντίος, ἐγγύς, προσήκει, πρέπει, ἐπιτήδειος,  σύμφωνος, etc.

On this principle the Dative follows words like---I am present (πάρειμι), I live with (παροικῶ), and prepositions describing proximity of various kinds.

- παρά, by side of, at house of.
- ἐπί, on top of, and metaph. on condition of, with view to, in addition to.
- πρός, near to, and metaph. in addition to.
- ὑπέρ, above (rare: usually genitive).
- περί, about (rare: usually genitive).
- ὑπό, under (but often genitive).
- σύν, with (always dative),

## § 38. Case after Verb 'to be,' or Passive.

After Passives or Verbs 'to be,' ' to become,' ' to appear,' the construction of the person is continued unbroken; i.e. Adjectives or Predicate Substantives are in the same case as the foregoing Substantive or Pronoun. This construction is familiar from Latin. The rule given, § 34, about the Nominative, is clearly only a special case of this---

- The man was good. <br />ὁ ἀνὴρ ἦν ἀγαθός.
- They were said to be women. <br />γυναῖκες ἐλέγοντο εἶναι.
- It is open to me to become a king. <br />ἔξεστί μοι βασιλεῖ γενέσθαι.
- I said he was called Athenian. <br />τοῦτον ἔφην Ἀθηνάϊον καλεῖσθαι.
- By those who seemed to be friends. <br />ὑπὸ τῶν δοκούντων φίλων εἶναι.
- These things being ready. <br />τούτων ἑτοίμων ὄντων.

In many cases the Accusative-Infinitive construction is substituted. Thus you can say---

- I ask you to be ready. <br />δεόμαί σον προθύμου εἶναι, or πρόθυμον εἶναι.
- It seemed bést to take up our arms and go. <br />ἔδοξεν ἡμῖν τὰ ὅπλα λαβοῦσιν ἀπιέναι, or λαβόντας.

# USE OF INFINITIVE.

## § 39. (1.) Prolate.

Besides the prolate use of the Infinitive, which is common in all languages, 6.6. after Verbs like 'I wish,' 'I learn,' 'I can,' 'I purpose,' and Adjectives like 'able,' ' easy,' ' eager,' there are other uses of the Infinitive in Greek not corresponding to the English idiom. A few of the chief examples are given below.

Prolate, but where English idiom is different.

- Capable of ruling. <br />ἱκανὸς ἄρχειν.
- He had a custom of going. <br />ἔθος ἦν τούτῳ ἰέναι.
- Clever at carrying. <br />δεινὸς φέρειν.
- I am in hopes of gowng. <br />ἐν ἐλπίδι εἰμὶ ἰέναι.

## § 40. (2.) Accusative and Nominative with the Infinitive.

After Verbs of saying and thinking, 'that' in English is often translated literally into Greek by ὅτι; but often also the idiom of the Accusative and Infinitive is employed as in Latin; the learner will be already familiar with it.

- He said that tt was ready. <br />ἕτοιμον εἶναι ἔφη.

Only observe, if the subject of the Infinitive Verb is the same as the subject of the principal Verb, it is Nominative, not Accusative.

- He said she was beautiful, but he was ugly. <br />ἐκείνην μὲν καλὴν ἔφη εἶναι, αὐτός δὲ αἰσχρός.

Note.---After Verbs of feeling and knowing, a Participle is used instead of Infinitive. See § 51 and § 34 above.

## § 41. (3.) Infinitive and Article.

The Article is used with the Infinitive, where we use an abstract-substantive or a periphrasis. It has been all explained above on the Article, § 8.

## § 42. Idioms with Infinitive.

There are certain special uses of verbs with the Infinitive which have to be learnt, as they could not be inferred from English, or from general principles of grammar. For example :---

- I know how to do tu. <br />ἐπίσταμαι δρᾶν.

\[Compare Participial use :--- <br />I know I am doing. ἐπίσταμαι δρῶν.\]

- I appear to do it. <br />φαίνομαι δρᾶν.

\[Compare Participial use :--- <br />I am proved to be doing tt. <br />φαίνομαι δρῶν.\]

- I promise to do it. <br />ὑπισχνοῦμαι δρᾶν, or δράσειν, or δρᾶσαι.
- I am about to do it. <br />μέλλω δρᾶν, or δράσειν, or δρᾶσαι.
- I hope to do it. <br />ἐλπίζω δρᾶν, or δράσειν, or δρᾶσαι.

# PARTICIPLE.

**§ 43.** The Participle is used much more in Greek than in modern English, and, though the uses of it are easy and natural, even the simplest narrative is so improved by properly employing it, that the point deserves careful attention.

We should first notice some special uses of the Participle with other verbs, where the Greek idiom differs from the English.

τυγχάνω.
~ He chanced to come. <br />ἔτυχεν ἐλθών.

ἥδομαι.
~ I take delight in doing. <br />ἥδομαι ποιῶν

χαίρω.
~ I should be pleased to get. <br />χαίροιμι ἂν λαβὼν.

παύομαι.
~ He ceased to run. <br />ἐπαύσατο τρέχων.

λανθάνω.
~ I came without their knowing. <br />ἔλαθον αὐτοὺς ἐλθών.
~ He did it without knowing. <br />ἔλαθεν ἑαυτόν δράσας.

φθάνω.
~ He seized him in time before he could jump down. <br />συλλαβὼν ἔφθασε πρὶν καταπηδᾶν.
~ He arrived in time before the surrender. <br />ἀφικόμενος ἔφθασε πρὶν προδοθῆναι τὴν πόλιν.

The ordinary idiomatic uses include a variety of clauses, where the Participle has very different effects upon the meaning; sometimes it gives a relation of time, sometimes of cause, sometimes of instrument, and so forth.

The case of the Participle naturally varies. Sometimes it agrees with the Substantive which is the subject or object of the sentence; sometimes, where the subject is changed, it will naturally be in the Genitive Absolute. The learner will be familiar with this principle from Latin, where the ablative is so used absolute; or if not, the examples will make it quite clear.

## § 44. a. Temporal.

(1.) Where two or more actions are related, and in English Principal Verbs are used, and the verbs are connected by ' and.'

- He came and spoke. <br />ἐλθὼν ἔλεξε.
- I stayed behind and worked. <br />ὑπομένων ἐπόνουν.
- He asked her to take it and break it. <br />λαβοῦσαν διαρρῆξαι.

So Genitive Absolute, with subject changed :---

- They were present and saw it, and he was tortured. <br />παοόντων ἐκείνων καὶ ὁρώντων ἐβασανίζετο.

(2.) Where in English Participles are employed, but often with prepositions, as on, after, in, or conjunctions, as wihile, when, the tense is determined by the sense; see Tenses,

- I saw him in passing. <br />παριὼν εἶδον.
- When working I am happy. <br />ἐν ἔργῳ ὧν εὖ ἔχω, or ἥδομαι.
- While wandering he fell in with me. <br />ἀλώμενος περιέτυχέ μοι.
- On hearing this she fell down. <br />τοῦτο ἀκούσασα κατέπεσε.
- After waiting some time, I ran off. <br />χρόνον τινὰ ἐπισχὼν ἀπέδραμον.

So Genitive Absolute, with new subject :---

- On their assenting he swore. <br />συναινεσάντων ἐκείνων ὤμοσε.
- He marched with his soldiers following. <br />ἑπομένων τῶν στρατιωτῶν ἐπορεύετο.

(3.) Where in English Subordinate Verbs are used with Conjunctions, as when, while, as.

- As he saw it he was pleased. <br />ἰδὼν ἤσθη.
- He was at a loss when he heard. <br />ἀκούσας ἠπόρει.

So with Genitive Absolute, subject changed :---

- When three days had elapsed they came back. <br />τριῶν ἡμερῶν γενομένων ἧκον.
- When night arrived. <br />νυκτὸς ἐπιγενομένης.
- He departed while it was still night. <br />ἀπῄει νυκτὸς ἔτι οὔσης.

(4.) Where in English Abstract Substantives are used with Prepositions.

- He waited in the hope. <br />ἐλπίζων περιέμενε.
- In great alarm she cried out. <br />ἡ δὲ μέγα φοβουμένη ἐβόησε.
- At the sight she fled. <br />ἰδοῦσα ἔφυγε.
- We watch you at work. <br />πονοῦντα θεωροῦμέν σε.

So with Genitive Absolute, subject changed :---

- On their departure she died. <br />ἀπελθόντων ἐκείνων ἐτελεύτησε.
- Amid the silence of all he departed. <br />σιγώντων ἁπάντων ἀπῄει.

## § 45. b. Instrumental.

In English a variety of ways adopted to express it, the commonest being a Participle, with the Preposition by, through. He did it by employing. ἐποίησε χρώμενος.

## § 46. c. Comparative.

The Comparison is commonly made in English by a clause with a Subordinate Verb, the clause being introduced by as, as if, as though. In Greek, ὡς or ὥσπερ would be used with Participle.

- He descended as if to retire. <br />κατέβη ὡς ἀποχωρήσων.
- He staggered as if he were drunk. <br />ὡς μεθύων ὀλίγου κατέπεσε.

So Genitive Absolute, with change of subject :---

- He ran as though a lion were after him. <br />ὥσπερ λέοντος διώκοντος ἀπέδραμε.

# § 47. Causal (often with ὥς, ἅτε).

- I will go with you, as I want to see. <br />συνέψομαί σοι, ὡς ἰδεῖν βουλόμενος.
- He was afraid, as he knew he was guilty. <br />ἐφοβεῖτο, ὡς ξυνειδὼς ἑαυτῷ, etc.

So Genitive Absolute, with change of subject :---

- Come, for I am ready to receive you. <br />ἐλθέ, ὡς ἐμοῦ θέλοντος δέξασθαι.
- As he stood near I moved away. <br />τοῦ δὲ παρεστῶτος, ἐγὼ ἀπῳχόμην.

In English, often a variety of expressions may be turned with ws and the causal participle, such as alleging, on the understanding that, on the plea that, imagining that.

- I will retire on the plea that you hate me. <br />ἀπωχωρήσω ὡς σοῦ μισοῦντος ἐμέ.
- They came on the understanding that no one would see them. <br />ἦλθον ὡς οὐδενὸς ὀψομένου.
- They asked to be forgiven, alleging ignorance. <br />ξυγγνώμην ᾔτησαν ὡς ἀγνοοῦντες.

## § 48. Final (often ὡς).

The Future Participle is used in Greek to express purpose, often with ws, sometimes with the Article.

- He sent a soldier to inquire. <br />ἐρωτήσοντα ἀπέπεμψε στρατιώτην.
- They started to overtake him. <br />ἀπεχώρησαν ὡς καταληψόμενοι,
- I shall send messengers to inform you. <br />πέμψω τοὺς ἀγγελοῦντας.

# § 49. Conditional Use.

Often the Participial Clause stands for a supposition : the Participle often being followed not unnaturally by the enclitic *γε*, which means 'at least.'

- Ιf you go away, you will find. <br />ἀπιὼν εὑρήσεις.
- If he is here, I shall rescue him. <br />σώσω αὐτὸν παρόντα γε.

So Genitive Absolute, with changed subject :---

- If you help me, I can accomplish it. <br />σοῦ γε ἐπαρκοῦντος οἷός τ᾽ εἰμὶ δρᾶν.

N.B.---In this use the Negative is μή.

- If you are not present, I shall be helpless. <br />σοῦ μὴ παρόντος ἀμήχανος ἔσομαι.
- If I do not do it, I shall be put to death. <br />μὴ δρῶν ἀποθανοῦμαι.

## § 50. Concessive Use.

Where in English we use 'though' and a verb, in Greek often the Participle and καίπερ, 'even,' is used, referring to a noun or pronoun already in the sentence, with no alteration of the case.

- Though old, he ran. <br />καίπερ γέρων ὧν ἔτρεχε.
- He killed her, though she was his mother. <br />ἔκτεινεν αὐτὴν καίπερ μητέρα οὖσαν.
- Though they were strong, he gave them orders. <br />ἐπέτασσεν αὐτοῖς καίπερ ἰσχυροῖς οὖσιν.

So Genitive Absolute, with subject changed :---

- Though many were present, he bathed. <br />καίπερ πολλῶν παρόντων ἐλούετο.

**§ 51.** Observe also that a Participle is used for the dependent clause after verbs of knowing and feeling (just as Infinitives are used for dependent clauses after verbs of saying and thinking). See § 40.

- I know that she is present. <br />ἐπίσταμαι αὐτὴν παροῦσαν.
- Do you not perceive it is disgraceful? <br />οὐκ αἰσθάνει αἰσχρὸν ὄν;

And the same rule holds here too, that the Nominative is used and not the Accusative, where the subject, of the two clauses is the same.

- She knew that she would die. <br />θανουμένη ᾔδη.
- I percewe I am ill. <br />νοσῶν αἰσθάνομαι.
- They discovered they were deceived. <br />ἔγνωσαν ἠπατημένον.

## § 52. Participle omitted in English.

The Participle (especially ὦν, being) is sometimes required in Greek where in English it is omitted altogether. This is chiefly in appositions, or where an attributive or descriptive sentence is added to a Substantive, as is often done in English without any Participle or Verb. The examples will make this more clear.

- There was an Aethop, cruel in disposition. <br />Αἰθίοψ ἦν τις ὠμὸς ὢν τὴν διάνοιαν.
- Socrates, once my friend, lately died. <br />Σωκράτης, πάλαι ποτὲ ὧν μοι φίλος, νεωστὶ ἐτελεύτησεν.
- I met my father without his coat. <br />τὸν πατέρα εἶδον ἄνευ τοῦ ἱματίου ὄντα.
- The Chians, men always without faith, revolted. <br />ἀπέστησαν οἱ Χῖοι, ἄνθρωποι ὄντες ἀεὶ ἄπιστοι.
- Together we are strong: separate, weak. <br />συνειλεγμένοι μὲν ἰσχυροί ἐσμεν, καθ´ ἕκαστον δὲ γενόμενοι, ἀσθενεῖς.

\[In many cases of apposition the clause can be turned in Greek eifher with Article or with Participle, as---

- The lion, the father of the cubs... <br />ὁ λέων, ὁ πατὴρ τῶν σκύμνων, or πατὴρ ὦν.
- The Getae, the remotest of savages...<br />οἱ Γέται, of ἔσχατοι τῶν βαρβάρων, or ἔσχατοι ὄντες.\]

## § 53. Relative and Participle.

There is a little point with reference to the use of Relative and Participle which needs clearing up, as confusing rules are sometimes given about it. Compare these two sentences :---

1. I met a Boeotian and a Megarian: the Boeotian, who was ill, could scarcely walk.
1. Two Boeotians I met, a healthy man and an invalid: the Boeotian who was ill could scarcely walk.

In (1) the relative clause *who was ill* is part of what is told about the Boeotian, i.e. practically part of the predicate.

In (2) the relative clause is part of the attribute, i.e. belongs to the subject.

Accordingly in Greek the two sentences become---

1. Βοιωτῶ τινί καὶ Μεγαρεῖ? ἐνέτυχον· ὁ δὲ Βοιωτὸς, νόσον ἔχων, μόλις ἐδύνατο βαδίζειν.

1. Βοιωτοῖν δυοῖν ἐνέτυχον, τῷ μὲν εὖ ἔχοντι τῷδὲ ἑτέρῳ νοσοῦντι· ὁ δὲ Βοιωτὸς ὁ νόσων ἔχων μόλις ἐδύνατο βαδίζειν.

# TENSE IDIOMS.

**§ 54.** There are tenses in Greek corresponding to most (though not all) of the English tenses, and in the Grammars, from which we first learn Greek, the corresponding English tenses are given as equivalents for the Greek tenses. But as in several points the idiom or usage differs, the learner is often misled by such translations in the Grammar. It is necessary, therefore, to consider these idiomatic usages in detail; and as we are here proceeding from English to Greek, the clearest method seems to be to take the English tenses in order, and see what becomes of them in Greek.

## English Present Indicative.

We have here two tenses, e.g. 'I learn,' and 'I am learning,' the former being an act (either single or repeated), and the latter a process or extended act.

Both are usually represented by the Greek Present Indicative.

Note, however, that sometimes when the act spoken of is *just over*, English uses the Present when Greek prefers the Aorist. Thus we often find---

- You speak well (speech being over). <br />καλῶς ἔλεξας.
- Do you ask me that? (question already asked.) <br />πότερον ταῦτα ἤρου;

## § 55. English Imperfect.

This is the same in Greek as in English.

- I was learning. <br />ἐμάνθανον.

Note, however, that the English Imperfect is sometimes due to *oratio obliqua*; the tense being really Present if the statement or question were put directly instead of indirectly. In this case the Greek does not change the tense from what it would be in oratio recta. Thus :---

- He said that he was sick. (What he said was, 'I am sick.') <br />ἔλεξεν ὅτι nοσεῖ.[^2]

- I asked why he was sick. (What I asked was, 'Why are you sick'?)<br />ἠρομῆν τί νοσεῖ.

## § 56. English Perfect.

Greeks use Perfect much less and Aorist much more than we do: the Perfect in English therefore often corresponds to the Aorist in Greek, chiefly when there is no emphasis on the *effect still lαsting*. 'Thus :---

- Look at the book I have bought. <br />ἰδοὺ τὸ βιβλίον ὅπερ ἐωνησάμην.
- I approve what you have said. <br />ἐπαινῶ ὅσα ἔλεξας.
- We have found it useful. <br />ὠφέλιμον εὕρομεν.

(2.) The English use Perfect sometimes where Greeks use Present; namely, when describing a pust state extending up to the present.

- For ten years I have been ill. <br />δέκα ἔτη voow.
- We have been long looking for you. <br />πάλαι σε ζητοῦμεν.
- All this time he has been cheating me. <br />τοσοῦτον χρόνον ἐξαπατᾷ με.

## § 57. English Pluperfect.

In speaking of past things (¢elling stories, narrating history, etc.), the Pluperfect is often required in English to describe the events of a point of time *still further back* than the one with which the sentence is chiefly concerned. In Greek, the common idiom is far less precise in the matter of time; both events being past, both are commonly Aorist or Imperfect. A few illustrations will show this.

- It did not at all turn out as he had expected. (Expectation previous to event.) <br />οὐχ ὡς προσεδέχετο οὐδαμῶς ἀπέβη.
- When the ships he had ordered arrived, he set sail. (Order previous to arrival and sailing). <br />ἀφικομένων TOV νεῶν ἃς μετεπέμψατο, εὐθὺς ἀνήγετο.
- He explained tt all. For the friend had come. (Coming previous to explanation.) <br />ἐδήλωσειτὸ πᾶν. ἦλθε yap ὁ φίλος.
- He met a man who formerly had been his friend (previous to meeting). <br />ἀνδρὶ περιέτυχέ τινι Os πρότερον φίλος ἣν ἑαυτῷ.

So constantly after ἐπεί, ἐπειδή, when, after that, the Aorist is used where we use Pluperfect.

- When he had finished. <br />ἐπεὶ ἐξετέλεσε.
- After he had gone away. <br />ἐπειδὴ ἀπῆλθε.

So again the English Pluperfect is often due to orativ dbliqua (see § 55): and it stands for a Perfect in oratio recta; the Greek tense will therefore still in many cases (§ 56) be Aorist, since *oratio obliqua* does not in Greek alter tenses,

Thus, turning the clauses in § 56 into the oblique :---

- He asked me to look at the book he HAD bought. <br />ἤτησε pe τὸ βιβλίον σκοπεῖν ὅπερ ἐωνήσατο.
- He said he approved what I HAD said. <br />ἐπαινεῖν ἔφη ὅσα ἔλεξα.
- I told him we HAD found it useful. <br />ἔλεξα ὅτι ὠφέλιμον εὕρομεν.

## § 58. English Past or Preterite and the Greek Imperfect and Aorist.

The English Past Tense corresponds commonly to the Greek Aorist, and then there is no difficulty; but also sometimes it is used where in Greek the Imperfect would be more natural. It is easy to turn the Tenses correctly if we remember that the Aorist in Greek expresses the Act, the Imperfect the Process or the Hubit. Not unfrequently either will do, as the act may be regarded, on the one hand, merely as an act without reference to its duration, or, on the other, stress may be laid on its taking time.

| | Aorist.|
|:----|:-----|
| Having said this he went away. I came, I saw, I conquered.|ταῦτα εἰπὼν ἀπεχώρησε. ἦλθον, εἶδον, ἐνίκησα. |
| | Imperfiect.|
|I negotiated with the Athenians while he conversed thus.| ἔπρασσον πρὸς τοὺς ᾿Αθηναίους ἕως τοιαῦτα διελέγετο. |
| I went to sophists to learn philosophy. | παρὰ σοφιστὰς ἐφοίτων ἵνα φιλοσοφίαν μάθοιμι. |
| He paid me every week my salary. | δι' ἑπτὰ ἡμερῶν ἀπεδίδον μοι τὸν μισθόν.|

## § 59. Special Use of Greek Imperfect.

The Imperfect in Greck, describing the protracted or extended process in the past, is often also used for a commenced or attempted action, and so may correspond to a variety of English expressions, some of which are given here.

- He was by way of denying. <br />ἀπηρνεῖτο.
- He proceeded to explain. <br />διηγεῖτο.
- He was ready to give (or offered). <br />ἐδίδου.

## § 60. Aorist Ingressive.

The Aorist is used sometimes to describe not merely the Act as opposed to the State, but the act as an entrance into the state. Thus compare the two Verbs contrasted in the following pairs :---

| | |
|:---|:---|
| He was ill. | ἐνόσει. |
| He fell ill. | ἐνόσησε. |
| He was afraid. | ἐφοβεῖτο. |
| He became alarmed. | ἐφοβήθη. |
| He was prosperous. | εὐτύχει. |
| He rose to prosperity. | εὐτύχησε.|

## § 61. English Present Infinitive and Greek Aorist Infinitive.

A common mistake is made by beginners in supposing the Aorist Infinitive to describe a past action. This is only so where the Infinitive is in oblique statement (oratio obliqua), and stands for a Finite Verb.

Thus, *he said that he came (or had come)* is *ἔφη ἐλθεῖν*.

But in sentences like *I wish to know, able to conquer, so as to find,* it is quite as good Greek to use Aorist as Present, and we might naturally say *βούλομαι γνῶναι, δυνατὸς νικῆσαι, ὥστε εὑρεῖν*, no less than *γιγνώσκειν, νικᾶν, and εὑρίσκειν*.

# SPECIAL IDIOM.

After *ὑπισχνεῖσθαι, to promise, ἐλπίζω, to hope, μέλλω, to be going,* the Future Infinitive is often used in Greek. See § 42.

## § 62. Greek Aorist in Imperative, Subjunctive, and Optative.

In all these three Moods the Greeks have two tenses corresponding to the English one. Thus :---

| | | |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Learn this. | μάνθανε τοῦτο.  | Imper.  |
| | μαθὲ τοῦτο. | |
| In order that I may learn. | ἵνα μανθάνω. | Subj. |
| | ἵνα μάθω. | |
| In order that I might learn. | ἵνα μανθάνοιμι. | Opt. |
| | ἵνα μάθοιμι. | |

The distinction between the Present and Aorist in each of these pairs is a very fine one (Aorist, expressing the act; Present, extended act or process), and as it is not observed in English it need not be attended to in the early stages of composition.

But the learner should get into the habit of remembering the existence of the Aorists when he has such clauses to translate, and using them as well as the Present.

The Aorist in the Participle and Infinitive is for practical convenience treated separately, though the principle of the usage is the same. See §61,

## § 63. English Present Tense Passive.

The Present Passive in English corresponds to two different Greek tenses according to circumstances, the Present and the Perfect.

(1.) Where *is-done* means is being done or is repeatedly done, the Present is used.

- The salt 1s brought down in ships. <br />ναυσὶ τὸ ἅλας κατακομίζεται.
- The officers are elected by show of hands. <br />λοχαγοὶ χειροτονοῦνται.
- I am grieved to find. <br />λυποῦμαι αἰσθόμενος.

(2.) Where is-done means 1s already done, use the Perfect.

- I am beaten in the fight. <br />τῃ μάχῃ νενίκημαι.
- In the book it ts written. <br />ἐν τῇ συγγραφὴ εἴρηται.

## § 64. English Past Tense Passive.

So 'was done' in English may mean three things :---

(1.) 'Was being done' or ' was often done.' Greek Imperfect.

- The salt was brought down. <br />τὸ ἅλας κατεκομίζετο.
- They were governed by kings. <br />ὑπὸ βασιλέων ἤρχοντο.
- The children were taught by the State. <br />δημοσίᾳ ἐδιδάσκοντο οἱ παῖδες.

(2.) 'Was done,' single act: in Greek use the Aorist.

- The battle was won. <br />ἐνικήθησαν μάχῃ.
- The town was taken. <br />ἑάλω ἡ πόλις;

(3.) 'Was already done,' 'were previously done:' in Greek use the Pluperfect.

- When I got there the enemy were defeated. <br />ἀφικομένου ἐμοῦ ἐνενίκηντο οἱ πολέμιοι.
- They did as they were told. <br />ἔδρασαν ὥσπερ εἴρητο.
- Before he left the peace was broken.<br />πρὶν ἀπιέναι ἐκεῖνον διελέλυντο αἳ σπονδαὶ.

## § 65. Future Passives.

There are two Future Passives in Greek :---

(1.) Aorist Future, formed from Aorist (first and second Future).

(2.) Perfect Future, formed from Perfect (paulo-post-futurum, or third Future).

The difference between them corresponds to the difference between the Perfect and Aorist; Perfect describing the state, Aorist the act. Thus :---

| | |
|:---|:---|
| I shall be abandoned. | λειφθήσομαι. |
| I shall find myself alone or bereft. | λελείψομαι.|
| | |
| I shall get a beating. | τυφθήσομαι. |
| I shall be black and blue. | τετύψομαι. |
| | |
| I shall be set free. | λυθήσομαι. |
| I shall be free. | λελύσομαι. |

Often in English the simple Future is used for both, with exactly the same ambiguity that we have noticed in the Present and Past of the Passive voice. The student will, however, find no difficulty if he will always think of the sense, and ask the simple question, Does it describe the future act or the future state?

- If the ships go out, the treaty will be broken. <br />\[Act\] λυθήσονται αἱ σπονδαί,

- By the time you get home the treaty will be broken. <br />\[State\] λελύσονται.

- When he dies he shall be buried. <br />\[Act\] ταφήσεται.

- Leave him here; he will be buried among his kindred. <br />\[State\] τεθάψεται.

## § 66. English Participle Perfect = Greek Aorist and Perfect.

We should observe that in Greek there are two Participles, the Perfect and Aorist, both of which are translated usually in Grammars, etc., by the English Perfect Participle, as, e.g. δράσας and δεδρακώς : both are rendered 'having done.' The learner, therefore, needs some hints, in doing English into Greek, as to which he is to use.

The fact is, δράσας describes the mere act of doing, δεδρακώς the state of having done; and which we use will, therefore, depend on the meaning of the English. Thus :---

| | |
|:--|:--|
| | Aorist. |
| Having shut the door, he went out. | κλείσας τὴν θύραν ἐξῆλθε. |
| Having been struck, he defended himself.| πληγεὶς ἠμύνατο. |
| Having prepared his plan, he marched. | παρασκευασάμενος τὸ βούλευμα ἐπορεύετο. |
| The girl fell wounded. | τρωθεῖσα κατέπεσεν ἡ κόρη. |

But---

| | |
|:--|:--|
| | Perfect. |
| Having been brought up softly. | μαλθακῶς τεθραμμένος. |
| Having suffered many years much outrage. | πολλὰ ἔτη δεινότατα πεπονθώς. |
| Twenty years old. | εἰκόσιν ἔτη γεγονώς. |
| He came with his mind madeup. | βεβουλευμένος ἦλθε. |
| We found the girl wounded. | εὕρομεν τὴν κόρην τετρωμενην. |

\[On the same principle, always Perfect when qualities, or personal description is given. \]

| | |
|:--|:--|
| Inclined to drunkenness. | πρὸς μέθην τετραμμένος. |
| Shod in Persian slippers. | Περσικὰς ὑποδεδεμένος. |

## § 67. English Participle Perfect = Greek Present.

On the other hand, the Greek Present Participle may be used where in English we should use the Past. This will follow from the same principle mentioned before, namely that in Greck the

- Aorist describes act simply,
- Present describes act extended, or state of doing.

Therefore if we say, 'After having learnt music ten years, he was still ignorant' (the act being extended), the Participle in Greek will naturally be Present, and it will run, ἔτη δέκα μανθάνων τὴν μουσικὴν ἔτι ἠγνόει.

So in the following examples :---

- Having once associated with him often, he deserted him <br />πρότερον πολλάκις συγγιγνόμενος ἀπέλιπε.
- After having suffered long, he expired. <br />πολὺν χρόνον νοσῶν ἐτελεύτησεν.

In this case, however, the Present Participle usually has some word to mark the time, like *πρότερον, ποτέ, πολὺν χρόνον,* etc.

## § 68. English Participle Present =Greek Aorist.

Observe, that in ordinary narrative, where there are two acts, and the first is described by a Participle, the second by a Principal Verb, the first in Greek is *Aorist*.

In English we often use the Present Participle for this, as will be seen from the examples :---

- Taking the bag, he opened it. <br />λαβὼν τὸν θύλακον ἀνέῳξε.
- Coming to him, he asked him. <br />ἀφικόμενος ἤτησεν αὐτόν.

If we used the Present Participle in Greek it would mean 'while he was taking, coming,' etc., since the Present implies an act extended in time, the Aorist an act simply. This principle being understood, the learner will soon discern those cases where either tense may be used, and those where they will more naturally be one or the other.

In the following kind of cases both will occur :---

- He learning this, and being indignant, answered. <br />ld μαθὼν τοῦτο καὶ δεινὸν ποιούμενος ἀπεκρίνατο.

## § 69. Indicative Optative with ἄν.

It is not my intention in this book to enter into the difficult syntax of the Optative, or the complications of the Conditional Sentence; but the use of ἄν with the Optative and Indicative may be readily learnt, even at an early stage, from one or two instances,

Where in English we say 'I would or should do,' in Greek is used the Optative (Present or Aorist) with the Particle ἄν, and where we say 'I would or should have done,' in Greek is used Indicative (Aorist) with av.

(1.) Optative.

- I would go. <br /> ἴοιμι ἄν.
- We should scarcely see. <br />μόλις ἂν σκεψαίμεθα,
- They could not conquer. <br />οὐκ ἂν δύναιντο νικᾶν.

(2.) Indicative.

- I should have come yesterday. <br />ἐχθὲς ἂν ἦλθον.
- Who would have known it? <br />τίς ἂν ἔγνω;
- All would have died. <br />ἀπέθανον ἂν πάντες.

Observe that ἂν never comes first, and never in an emphatic place.

## § 70. Subjunctive and Optative of Purpose.

ἵνα, ὥς, and ὅπως are used in Greek to express purpose. The mood is either Subjunctive or Optative, according to the tense of the principal verb; in fact the sequence varies as in Latin, only that it is a sequence of mvod and not of tense.

| | | |
|:--|:--|:--|
| | I come | |
| Primary. | I shall come | in order that I may find. |
| | I have come | |
| | ἀφικνοῦμαι | |
| | ἀφίξομαι | εὑρίσκω or εὕρω.
| | ἀφῖγμαι | |
| | | |
| | I came | |
| Historic. | was coming | in order that I might find. |
| | I had come | |
| | ἀφικόμην | |
| | ἀφικνούμην | ἵνα εὑρίσκοιμι or εὕροιμι. |
| | ἀφίγμην | |

If there is a negative after the ἵνα or ws, it is μή, not οὐ.

## § 71. ἔφη.

When a statement is quoted or related, the Greeks use either εἶπεν ὅτι, or εἶπε with Accusative Infinitive (oratio obliqua).

If the exact words are given (*oratio recta*), 1t is common to use the slightest word, namely, ἔφη, and to put one or two words of the quoted passage first, and then ἔφη. Thus :---

- 'Socrates,' I said, 'are you there? <br />ὦ Σώκρατες, ἔφην, μῶν πάρει;
- And he said 'Yes, I have been here a long while.' <br />ὁ δὲ Πάλαι γάρ, ἔφη, πάρειμι.

## § 72. Emphatic Position.

In English, a word in a sentence often gets emphasis by the use of the expression i is, it was, when in Greek (as in Latin) the emphasis can be quite as clearly and much more neatly given by the position of the word. Thus :---

- It was yesterday I came. <br/>ἐχθὲς ἦλθον.
- It is you I have been expecting; but it is he who is come. <br />σὲ μὲν πάλαι προσδοκῶ· οὗτος δὲ ἥκει.

## § 73. Adverbs of Place.

One caution is required in doing Greek composition about Adverbs of Place.

In English we often use there, here, where, not only after Verbs of rest, where they are legitimate, but also after Verbs of motion, where they stand for the more correct thither, hither, whither. In Greek this license is never allowed, and the learner must be on his guard therefore.

- Come here. <br />δεῦρο ἐλθέ (not ἐνθάδε).
- He went there. <br />ἤει ἐκεῖσε (not ἐκεῖ).
- Where are they gone? <br />ποῖ οἴχονται (not ποῦ);

## § 74. Interrogations.

There are a great variety of ways of asking questions in Greek, corresponding to the number of Interrogative Particles. The principal are given below.

(1.) No Particle.

- Will you come forward? <br />θέλεις παρελθεῖν
- Can you help me? <br />δύνασαί μοι ἐπαρκεῖν;

(2.) οὐ, οὔκουν, dp' οὐ, πῶς οὔ (the latter especially used where the question is impatient or indignant).

- Shall you not fight? <br />οὐ μαχεῖ;
- Are we not then come? <br />οὔκουν ἀφίγμεθα;
- Is tt not impudent? <br />πῶς οὐκ ἀναιδές ἐστι;

(3.) ἄλλο τι, ἄλλο τι ἤ.

- Have we not made a mistake? <br />ἄλλο τι ἁμαρτάνομεν;
- Do not the dead sleep? <br />ἄλλο τι ἢ οἱ τεθνηκότες καθευδουσι;

(4.) μῶν, μὴ, ἄρα μή, μῶν μή.

- Do you think we have not said enough? <br />μῶν μή δοκεῖ ἐνδεῶς λελέχθαι;
- Does he do you wrong? <br />μῶν τί σε ἀδικεῖ;
- Do we seem to you? <br />μή σοι δοκοῦμεν;

(5.) πότερον (alternative questions chiefly; but often in simple questions, since they can always be put alternatively : Is it so or not?).

- Shall you conquer or not? <br />πότερον νικήσεις αὐτόν, ἡ OV;

- Will they dispute this? <br />πότερον τοῦτο ἀμφισβητήσουσι;

Of these, (2) and (3) expect answer ' yes;' in (4) answer is negative or doubtful; in (1) and (5) answer is doubtful.

I have said nothing about interrogatives like ris, πότε, ποῦ, πῶς, etc., as there is no difficulty with these.

## § 75. Dramatic Particles.

The Greek being more lively than English, dramatic particles are often inserted in Greek where in English none are used. Such particles are δή, apa, and the following instances from the Exercises will illustrate the difference between the languages :---

- For this I give thanks. <br />τούτου δὴ χώριν ἔχω.
- To know what the others think. <br />εἰδέναι τί ἄρα οἱ ἕτεροι οἴονται.
- Remained as though working. \[Appearance put on.\] <br />ἔμενον ws ἐργαζόμενοι δὴ.
- Wondering how the letter saw. <br />θαυμάσας πῶς dpa ἡ ἐπιστολὴ εἶδεν.
- We are in terrible danger. <br />ἐν δεινῷ δὴ κινδύνῳ ἐσμέν.
- We are now helpless. <br />ἀμήχανοι δὴ νῦν ἐσμέν.

Sometimes they stand in a lively way for a word like alleged, supposed, in English.

- He brought in the supposed women. <br />\[They were really conspirators dressed up.\] <br />εἰσήγαγε τὰς γυναῖκας δή.
- The supposed new cloth. <br />\[Really nothing.\] <br />τὸ νέον δὴ ὕφασμα.

## § 76. μέν and δέ.

When a sentence contains two clauses opposed or antithetic to each other, it is customary to mark this antithesis clearly in Greek, by putting μέν with the first and δέ with the second.

In English we do this sometimes by particles :---

- ... indeed ... but ...,
- or,--- on the one hand ... on the other ...;

sometimes with only one, or even no particle at all. Thus it is necessary for the learner to be on his guard, that he may not omit the μέν and δέ when they are required. Examples :---

- I indeed am strong, but you are weak. <br />ἐγὼ μὲν ἰσχυρός, σὺ δὲ ἀσθενής.
- On the one hand there is danger if we try; on the other, there is no hope if we do not try. <br />καὶ πειρωμένοις μὲν κίνδυνός ἐστιν μὴ πειρωμένοις δὲ οὐδεμία ἐλπίς.

\[One omitted. \]

- Before he was happy, but now he is wretched. <br />πρότερον μὲν εὐτυχὴς ἦν---νῦν δὲ ἄθλιος,

\[Both omitted. \]

- The Athenians loved poets; the Spartans did not. <br />οἱ μὲν ᾿Αθηναῖοι ἐφίλουν τοὺς ποιητάς· οἱ δὲ Λακεδαιμόνιοι οὔ.

## § 77. Negatives.

There are two Negatives, ov and μή, usually distinguished as ov negative of Statement, μή negative of Conception. The ᾿ definition becomes intelligible by looking at the usage.

(1.) οὐ, Negative Statement.

- Nothing happens. <br />οὐδὲν γίγνεται.
- I know that no one saw. <br />οἶδα οὐδένα ἰδόντα.
- You must not do it. <br />oὐ χρὴ δρᾶν.
- Will you not go away? <br />οὐκ ἄπει;
- I should not come. <br />οὐκ ἂν ἔλθοιμι.
- I asked why it was not done. <br />ἠρόμην τί οὐκ ἐγένετο.
- It is not possible that you are not friendly. <br />οὐκ ἔσθ᾽ ὅπως οὐ φίλος εἶ.
- He announced that no one was there. <br />οὐδένα ἤγγειλε παρόντα, or παρεῖναι.
- Though I had nothing I was rich. <br />καΐπερ οὐδὲν ἔχων ἐπλούτουν.

(2.) μή, Negative Conception.

| | | |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Purpose, | That I might not do. | ἴνα μὴ δράσαιμι. |
| Prohibition, | Don't do. | μὴ δρᾶ.|\
| Oblique | Ι asked him not to do. | ἥτησα μὴ δρᾶν. |
| Petition. | Ι forbid to do. | ἀπαγορεύω μὴ δρᾶν. |
| | Ι ought not to do it. | χρὴ μὴ δρᾶν (or by (1) οὐ χρὴ). |

So with βούλομαι, δεῖ, ὥφελον, etc.

| | | |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Generic. | Those who were not there. | οἱ μὴ παρόντες.  |
| | Dishonourable things. | τὰ μὴ καλά. |
| Condition. | Ιf you are not ill. | εἰ μὴ νοσεῖς. |
| | You are wrong not to do this. | ἁμαρτάνεις μὴ ποιῶν τάδε. |

Most of the other uses of μὴ will be learnt later.

## § 78. 'Any,' 'ever,' 'as yet,' etc., after Negative.

In Greek the idiom of the Negatives differs so far from the idiom in English, that all the Indefinite words following a negative are also themselves negative. Thus :---

- Ι never heard anything anywhere from anybody. <br />οὔδεποτε ἤκουσα οὐδὲν οὐδαμοῦ οὐδενός.

The words thus used are chiefly the following :---

| | |
|:--|:--|
| nobody | οὐδείς.
| never | οὔποτε. |
| nowhere | οὐδαμοῦ. |
| from nowhere | οὐδαμόθεν. |
| to nowhere | οὐδαμόσε. |
| nohow | οὔπως. |
| not yet | οὔπω. |

If μή is required in the first negative, the others will all begin with μή :---

- Don't give anything to anybody. <br />μὴ δίδου μηδὲν μηδενί.

So 'even' after negative becomes in Greek not even, οὐδέ.

- No woman even tries.<br />οὐδεμία γυνὴ οὐδὲ πειράται.

## § 79. 'That' in English.

For the help of the beginner, it may be useful to tabulate the various ways in which the word 'that' is used, and the corresponding Greek words or idioms.

(1.) Demonstrative (ἐκεῖνος, or sometimes οὗτος).

- That man.<br />ἐκεῖνος ὁ ἄνθρωπος.
- That is a great pleasure. <br />τοῦτο ἤδιστόν ἐστιν.

(2.) Relative (ὅς or ὅσπερ).

- The man that I saw. <br />ἀνὴρ ὃν εἶδον.
- The woman that came. <br />ἡ γυνὴ ἥπερ ἦλθεν.

(3.) Conjunction.

a. After verbs of saying or thinking: Accusative (or Nominative) and Infinitive, § 40.
    * I said that the moon was bright. <br />εἶπον τὴν σελήνην λαμπρὰν εἶναι.
    * I don't think that you will come. οὐκ οἴομαι σὲ ἡξειν.
    * We think that we shall be rich. <br />πλούσιοι οἰόμεθα ἔσεσθαι.
b. After verbs of knowing and feeling: Accusative (or Nominative) and Participle, § 51.
    * I know that he is here. <br />οἶδα αὐτὸν παρόντα.
    * I perceive that I am sick. <br /> αἰσθάνομαι νοσῶν.

(Both (a) and (b) can also be done with ὅτι, only be careful about tenses, § 64.)

c. After verbs of asking, etc.: Infinitive: and Accusative if subject is required.
    * He ordered that she should come, and the rest stay.<br />ἐκέλευσεν ἐλθεῖν μὲν ἐκείνην, τοὺς δὲ ἄλλους μένειν.
    * It is needful that you should be put to death. <br />ἀνάγκη ὑμᾶς ἀποθανεῖν.
d. After Abstract Substantives 'the fact that:' τὸ and Accusative with Infinitive, § 8.
    * The fact that we are conquered. <br />τὸ ἡμᾶς ἡσσᾶσθαι.
e. After Demonstratives ('so,' 'such,' etc.): ὥστε. 
    * He was so strong, that he killed her. <br /> οὕτως ἰσχυρὸς ἦν ὥστε ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτήν.
f. Expressing purpose: iva, ws, ὅπως, § 70. 
    * I worked that I might grow rich. <br />ἐπόνουν ἵνα πλουτήσαιμι. 


## § 80. 'Neither, nor.'

The beginner is always puzzled with οὔτε and οὐδέ difference between them is this :---

When two negative clauses are on the same footing, and you start with an intention to make both denials, you then use in English *Neither ... nor*, and in Greek you use *οὔτε ... οὔτε*.

When, however, you begin with one negative clause standing alone, and then add another, in English you use *not . . . nor*, and in Greek *οὐκ... οὐδέ*.

The same is true of μήτε, μηδέ.

1.
    * Neither cows nor horses. <br />οὔτε βόες οὔτε ἵπποι.
    * I will neither remain nor depart. <br />οὔτε μενῶ οὔτε ἄπειμι.
    * It is good to be neither rich nor poor. <br />εν ἄμεινον μήτε πλόυσιον μήτε πένητα εἶναι.
2. 
    * It is not hot, nor cold.<br />οὐ θερμόν, οὐδὲ ψυχρόν ἐστιν.
    * It is not just, nor indeed profitable. <br />οὐ δίκαιόν ἐστιν· οὐδὲ μὴν λυσιτελές.
    * Do not be angry, nor curse. <br />μὴ θυμοῦσθε, μηδὲ καταρᾶσθε.


# EXERCISES.

We will suppose the learner to have mastered the Article *ὁ ἡ τό* and the first two Declensions, namely, the A Declensionσ, with its five forms (all very like), say--- 

| | |
|:--|:--|
| Masculines. | Feminines. |
| νεανίας \| κριτής | χώρα \| τιμή \| μοῦσα|

Also the O Declension, both Simple and Contracted; for example---

| | |
|:--|:--|
| Simple. | Contracted. |
λόγος \| δῶρον | νόος--νοῦς \| ὀστέον---ὀστοῦν |

with the Attic Declension, as λεώς, ἀνώγεων.

These declensions are the first two in most Grammars; and the advantage of dividing them thus, and calling them A and O Declensions, is that the reason of the differences in termination is then so clearly seen.

With these should be learnt the Adjectives which follow these declensions, namely, for example---

- *σοφός, σοφή, σοφόν* | *ἴδιος, ἰδία, ἴδιον*

and the contracted forms, χρυσέος, ἀργυρέος (-οὔς).

These really add nothing to the trouble, for they simply follow the three genders of the Substantive.

Also should be learnt ὅς, ἥ, ὅ, exactly like σοφός (except 6 neuter), and οὗτος, ὅδε, ἐκεῖνος, τοσοῦτος, τοιοῦτος, and αὐτός, all very like each other.

Then we are ready to begin our first Exercises.

In order to enable the learner at once to make whole sentences, which is much less wearisome than doing meaningless fragments, the principal parts of the verb 'to be' are here given, to be used in the Exercises.

| | |
|:--|:--|
| I am, εἰμί. | I was, ἦν.|
|Thou art, εἶ. | Thou wast, ἦσθα.|
|He, she, it, there---is, ἐστί,| He, she, it, there---was, ἦν. |
|We are, ἐσμέν. | We were, ἦμεν. |
| You are, ἐστέ. | You were, ἦτε. |
|There are, they are, εἰσί, |There were, they were, ἦσαν.|


| |
|:--|
| I shall be, ἔσομαι.|
| Thou wilt be, ἔσει.|
| He, she, it, there---will be, ἔσται.|
| We shall be, ἐσόμεθα.|
| You will be, ἔσεσθε.|
| There will be, they will be, ἔσονται.|
| To be, εἶναι.|

Note.---The rarely-required Dual is omitted at present, in order to avoid needless trouble.

ἐστί and εἰσί are written ἐστίν and εἰσίν before a vowel or a full stop.

Occasionally throughout the Exercises a few words will be given which the learner has not yet reached in the Grammar. The sentences will thus be more varied, and so less tiresome; and it will do him no harm to become familiarised in a natural and easy way with the look of some of the commoner words.

Note.---In the vocabularies the following signs are used :---

| |
|:--|:--|
| a.  accusative. | m. masculine.|
| d.  dative. | f. feminine.|
| g.  genitive. | n. neuter.|

† denotes that the word cannot come first after a stop.

Perhaps a bone of this swan was broken (δι-ερράγη) by a stone. There is a small boat on the lake.

Another is asleep (καθεύδει), but the third is by the rudder. This (one) does not see (ὁρᾷ, acc.) the terrible danger, for there is a rock in the lake. And this[^7] rock is hard, and will be the cause of death to many. Now they are close to the place, and I am pale from fear. I turn away (ἀποτρέπω, acc.)[^8] my eyes. Behold, they are out of the danger, and from joy tears are in my eyes.

This horse is mine. Before^[§ 76.] he was strong, but now he is very thin and poor. And the cause of this I will tell (λέξω, acc.). Those farmers to whom I intrusted (ἐπέτρεπον, acc.) him were very faithless. They stole (ἔκλεπτον, acc.) the corn of the horse. But the device is good which I have (ἔχω, acc.), for I put (ἔθηκα, acc.) stones into the manger. The horse eating (ἐσθίων, acc.) the corn spits out (ἀποπτύει, acc.) the stones. But the farmers steal (κλέπτουσι, acc.) the corn with the stones. In this way^[§ 37 (e).] it is easy to find out (ἐξ-ευρεῖν, acc.) the deceit. The farmers therefore will no longer be bad. For the penalty to them will be dreadful and severe.

- victory, νίκη.

Already the army is in the camp, and the fleet by the shore of this island. The enemy are on the hill, which is opposite to our camp. To-morrow, perhaps, there will be a battle: for they appear (δοκοῦσι) to be prepared.^[§ 34.] But this^[§ 28.] is the plan of our general. For now everything is dark, and the fires of the enemy are few. Accordingly it will not be difficult for our soldiers to go (ἐλθεῖν) secretly to them, and cut off (dzore- μεῖν, acc.) the heads of many. And thus to-morrow few will be alive, and the victory will be ours.

For he stands (éornxe) near, on the very ditch itself.^[§ 16.] Alas, now he is in the middle of the^[§ 4.] mud. And the others are in a difficulty, and will not be able to pull out (ἐξέλκειν, acc.) their companion. For this the master alone is able to do (ποιεῖν, acc.), who is at home. But among the horses is one, who is far wiser (σοφώτερος) than (gen.) the others. And he runs (τρέχει) to the house, and with his head^[§ 37 (d).] strikes (παίει, acc.) the door. And thus the mischief is plain to the master, and he pulls (ἐξέλκει, acc.) out the horse.

## EXERCISE VI.

And a certain slave of those^[§ 6.] in the house stole (ἔκλεψε, acc.) the brick: but the thief was unknown to the master. But there was a wise judge in the country: and he by this device found out (ἐξεῦρε, acc.) everything.

For the slaves were around him, being collected together. And there was very great fear of the judge. And he spoke (εἶπε, acc.) this word: 'The thief has (ἔχει, acc.) a feather on his^[§ 21.] head.' And the others^[§ 76.] were quiet, but the thief quickly shook (ἐτίναξε, acc.) his head, and so was manifest to the slaves and to the judge.

And my brother was once in the cavern, and being weighed down (βαρυνόμενος) by sleep he lay (ἔκειτο) for^[§ 36 (b).] a long time quiet. But suddenly he saw (εἶδε, acc.) bright eyes through the darkness. And he was in great fear. For the wolf has such eyes,^[You may use the article, and say 'the eyes are such.'] and the country is full of wolves. But the goat meanwhile licked (ἔλειχε, acc.) the fingers of his left (hand), and he had no longer any^[§ 78.] fear.

In this wood are numberless bees flying (πετόμενος) every way very-quickly. Where is the place in which the house of these is? It is probably in some one of these large trees. For often the wood is rotten, on account of the long time and the dreadful rain. And thus in the hollow \[use neuter of adjective\] is a cavern, which, not without trouble, has been made (πεποίηται) by the bees into (és, acc.) a house. And this is wonderful, that not men are most-hateful (ἔχθιστος) to the bees, but bears. For these are like children, and they have (there is to them) a very-great desire of very-sweet things.^[§ 2.]

## EXERCISE IX.

And sometimes the corn was scanty for the men and the fodder for the horses. And then he used-to-send (ἔπεμπε, acc.) loaves to them, and about the fodder he said (ἔφη, acc.) this: I have (use éor/) fodder, owing to the care of my slaves: I will give (δώσω) therefore to my friends: for to whom a man is dear, to him no less is his horse.

Now this beast is strong,^[§ 76.] but foolish and cowardly. For it does not come (ἔρχεται) to battle with (dat. simply) its enemies, but, from fear of the danger, flies (φεύγει). And sometimes it has (ἔχει, acc.) very terrible fear, and then it thrusts (ὠθεῖ, acc.) its head into the sand: but the rest is not hidden (adj.): but the bird is manifest to the hunters.


## EXERCISE XI.

### **Sheep and Wolves.**

fable, μῦθος. wiser, σοφώτερος. sheep, προβάτιον. life, Bios. sheep, pl., πρόβατα, n. friendship, φιλία. council, βουλή. peace, εἰρήνη. evil, κακόν. with (make peace, war), πρός, ἃ. injustice, ἀδικία, peaceful, εἰρηνικός. from (suffer), ὑπό, 8. Sight, μάχη.

This! is a fable about the wolves and the sheep, in what? (οἷος) way the council took place (ἐγένετο) about the evils and the injustice. For the sheep suffered (ἔπασχε) dreadful things? from the wolves: so there was no longer any' safety for them in the country. And on account of this it was necessary to find (εὑρεῖν, acc.) some device. And a sheep there was, wiser than (gen.) the others, and he said (εἶπε, acc.) these® things :---'O sheep, life to us is evil owing to these® wolves. There shall therefore be a council, and the wolves shall be present (παρέσονται), and we will persuade (πείσομεν, acc.) them to make (ποιεῖσθαι, acc.) friendship and peace with us. For I am peaceful, and the fight with' the wolves is not dear to me.'

### VOCABULARY.

gathering, σύλλογος. both, ἀμφότεροι. unjust, ἄδικος. rights, τὸ δικαίον. law, νόμος. from (given or passed from), more, μᾶλλον. παρά, g. such as this, τοιόσδε. at the time, τότε μὲν. before (motion), πρός, a. not at all, οὐδαμῶς.

There was therefore a gathering of the sheep to council: and the wolves themselves also came (ἦλθον), nor were they hindered (ἐκωλύοντο) by them. And the sheep said these things :---' We are? in terrible danger, being worried (ἅρπα- ζόμενος) by the wolves. And this is unjust: so we wish (βουλόμεθα) to have (ἔχειν, acc.) some law, and thus to be more in safety.' And the wolves said this to them :---' There shall then be a law for you such-as-this: the sheep that is? wronged (ἀδικούμενος) by a wolf shall bring (ἄξει, acc.) the unjust (one) before our council, and both shall have (use εἰμί, to be) their rights from us.' And at the time? it was delightful to the sheep: but the injustice of the wolves became (ἐγένετο) not at all less.

Pigeons are sensible, and very clever at-carrying (inf. φέρειν, acc.) letters. This they do (ποιοῦσι, acc.) in a manner somewhat as follows :---The pigeon loves (φιλεῖ, acc.) its! home, and is shrewd: and so the way to? its home it finds (εὑρίσκει, acc.) easily.

And once there was a fortress of the Mamedaioi, which was under (ἐν, dat.) siege from (ὑπό, gen.) the enemy. And about midday once a soldier of the enemy saw (εἶδε, acc.) a pigeon above in the sky flying (πετόμενος, partic.). And under its wings was something white, as if it were a letter. Thereupon there was desire to the soldiers to catch (λαβεῖν, acc.) the bird. And they made (ἐποιοῦντο, acc.) trial of their arrows: but they were not at all useful.

And immediately there arose (ἐγένετο) a shout of the soldiers : for there was dreadful indignation at the escape of the pigeon.

And she was in fear owing to the noise, and fell (ἔπεσε) straightway into the camp. And they untied (ἔλυσαν, acc.) the letter about! its neck : and in this were words as follows :---

"Ὁ dear citizens of the Mamedaioi, why do ye feel (ἔχετε, acc.) such fear concerning the siege? There will be no lack to you of assistance. For we are making (ποιούμεθα, acc.) a wonderful preparation. And the tyrant will bring (ἄξει, acc.) an army, and after five days we shall be close to your fortification. Therefore it is foolish to be in distress. For quickly you shall have (use verb 'to be') victory and plenty of provisions.' Such then was the letter.

And the soldiers had (use εἰμί) very-great joy at this. For the plan of the enemy was now manifest, not less than the (gen.) distress of the Mamedaioi.

Accordingly they wrote (ἔγραψαν, acc.) another letter instead of the former one. And it was as follows :---

"Ὁ dear citizens of the Mamedaioi, we are! now helpless. For we are not able at all to give you (δοῦναι, dat. and acc.) aid. For the tyrant has (ἔχει, inf.) in (his) mind to make (ποιεῖσθαι, acc.) another expedition. But we are not altogether hopeless about you, for you are brave and strong for (és, acc.) the war.'

And this the pigeon carried (ἔφερε, acc.) into the fortress to the Mamedaioi. And those! within had (εἰμί) extreme fear. And they surrendered (ἐνέδοσαν, acc.) themselves to them, And after five days appeared (ἐφάνη) the tyrant with the army : but the enemy were already within.

NOTE AFTER EXERCISE 15.

So far we have used none but the A and O Declensions, including not only the Substantives, but the Adjectives and Pronouns which are similarly declined.

We now shall add the Consonant Declensions; 1.6. we shall use all Substantives, Adjectives, and Pronouns, without any restriction: and also Participles, which are similarly declined, though as the Verbs are not yet learnt, the Nominative Singular of the Participle will be given.

As to the Verbs, we shall still only assume knowledge of the parts of εἰμί, to be, given on page 66; and all other verbs required will be given in the Exercises in the part which is wanted.

The learner will thus be familiarised with some of the common terminations before definitely learning the Verbs.

In the Vocabulary henceforth we shall give the sfem of the Substantives which belong to the Consonant-declension: so that the student will have no need to look the word out in grammar or dictionary, tf he kners his Declensions.

Thus, supposing he wants the Genitive Singular and Dative Plural of ὄνυξ, he finds in the Vocabulary ὄνυξ (-vy-): this teaches him that the sfem is orvy-, and from that he knows that the Genitive Singular is ὄνυχος, and the Dative Plural ὄνιξι.

Ots.---Unless the contrary is stated, Nouns in -os are masculine, like λόγος : in -α and -», fem.: in -ov, neut. Also Nouns in -ts are feminine.

There was a wood thick with! all manner of trees and plants, and here was a great multitude of birds and beasts. And no one was in greater honour than (gen.) the elephant. And there was once a gathering of the other beasts, and much talk took place (ἐγένετο) about him. 'What is the cause,' they said (ἔφασαν), 'of the honour of the elephant (dat.) 1᾽ And some thought (use ἐδόκει, 'seemed,' with dative of person) one cause and some another.?

And first the speech of the fox was as follows: 'Why is this one better than we (are)? Not at all, I suppose (οἶμαι), on account of his tail, for he has (use ἐστί) a very small and ugly one.' And at the same time while speaking (λέγων, particip.) he moved (exivet, acc.) his own long and soft tail. ---

'You are right,'\* replied (ἔφασαν) the others, with much laughter and applause.

And after him the bear said (εἶπε) as follows: ' This! is true; but honour comes (γίγνεται) to one reasonably from claws: for without claws, I suppose (που), one is inferior in? beauty? : but the elephant' has nothing of that kind (say ' such'): and this is plain to all.'

And here the ox struck in (ὑπέλαβε), saying (λέγων) : "1, however, recognise (γιγνώσκω, acc.) the cause : for this one has (use ' to be') two long teeth, projecting (προέχων, -ovr-) out of his mouth: and these seem (δοκοῦσι) to the others to be like horns: and no one of course knows (οἶδέ, acc.) anything® more beautiful than horns.'

And last the ass said this : ' You are all! ignorant and foolish : for what honour is there to horns at least and tails?3 Surely not so, but the fine glory is that paid to (say 'is of') ears. The honour therefore has come (γέγονε) to the elephant owing to his ears.'

And this was pleasing to the hunter, and sitting on the ground he gave (ἔδωκε, acc.) some of his food to the cubs: and at the same time he ate (ῆσθιε) with them himself? also. But the lioness, the mother! of the cubs, came (ἦλθε) in the meantime, and she saw (εἶδε, acc.) the man and the cubs eating (ἐσθίων, -ovr-) together. Then no longer did she have (use ἦν) desire to seize (συλλαβεῖν, acc.) the man, but she went away (dxyec) and killed (ἔκτεινε, acc.) a deer, and brought (έφερε, acc.) it to him.

How impudent he is in his gestures!! and yet he appears (δοκεῖ) to himself to be most beautiful.2 And about myself I will say (λέξω) nothing: for how am 1 like to such-an-one? Far better (n.) to be killed (ἀποθανεῖν) with a dagger than to have (ἔχειν, acc.) such shame among all men! But there are, methinks, some of our friends, O my companion, to whom this (fellow) is extremely like: for they imitate (μιμοῦνται, acc.) in face'\* that beast, and have (ἔχουσι) the same kind of antics and folly.'

But to the bear the thing? appeared (ἐφαίνετο) laughable, but he answered (ἀντεῖπε, acc.) nothing.

The Egyptians have (use verb 'to be') many stories of all kinds about all matters, and especially about Spirits. For these have great care! for mankind, and with their power are able to perform (ἐξεργάζεσθαι, acc.) wonderful things.2 And some of these stories I will tell (λέξω, acc.).

For once there was a Spirit who had (εἰμῶ much gold, hidden below the earth. And it was necessary once for him to go away (ἀπελθεῖν). For there is one most powerful and greatest of the Spirits, the king® of the rest: and it had been ordered (εἴρητο, dat.) to him by the king to go away into Asia. And then he was in great grief and distress about his gold: for it was not possible for him to take it away (ἀποφέρειν, acc.) with him. For this is always forbidden to the Spirits. How then shall the gold be in safety ἢ

1 § 35 (bd). 2 § 30. δ § 52. 4 8 16.

The learner has now got accustomed sufficiently to the Substantives and Adjectives and Pronouns alone, and also to the Verb 'to be:' it is time to begin working the Verbs steadily. We will begin with the Active Verb, using at first only those whose tenses are conjugated regularly, as far as regards the terminations, like the subjoined examples, and using only Present, Future, Imperfect, Strong Aorist; then adding later the Weak Aorist, the Perfect, and the Pluperfect.

PRESENT. Av-w 1\] loose λύ-εις Thou loosest Singular, λύ-ει He looses λύ-ετον You two loose λύ-ετον They two loose Dual λύ-ομεν We loose λύ-ετε Ye loose Plural. λύουσι They loose

The Future Avo-w, 'I shall loose,' has exactly the same terminations as the Present.

IMPERFECT. ἔλυ-ον I was loosing. ἔλυ-ες Thou wast loosing. ἔλυ-ε fe was loosing. éAv-erov You two were loosing. ἐλυ-έτην They two were loosing. ἐλύτομεν We éAv-ere You pwere loosing. ἔλυ-ον They

STRONG AORIST.

ἔλαβ-ον 7 took. ἔλαβ.-ες Thou tookest. ἔλαβ-ε He took.

ἐλάβ-ετον You two took ἐλαβ-έτην They two ᾿ 00K.

ἐλάβ-ομεν We ἐλάβ-ετε You took. ἔλαβ-ον They

Notice that all the Strong Aorists which end in -ov have exactly the same terminations as the Imperfect.

AUGMENT.

Observe that the Imperfect and Aorist have e before them. This is called the Augment, and is the mark of a past tense.

(1.) If the Verb begin with consonant, ἐ is prefixed. Only Verbs beginning with p have p doubled, as ἔρ-ριπτον.

(2.) If with a Vowel the following changes take place :--- a becomes ἡ, aS ἅπτω, ἧπτον. ε " ἢ, 9 ἐθέλω, ἤθελον.

And in the same city where the gold was, there was also a certain man, rich and miserly. To him therefore the Spint coming (προσελθών) by night spoke (ἔλεξε, acc.) as follows :---

'Friend, there is no need (οὐδὲν δεῖ) for you (acc.) to be in fear about me. For you are known to me and dear this long time. And from good-will I have now come to you (aorist). For I have much gold here, and it will no longer be useful to me. For I am about (μέλλω) to go abroad (ἀποδημεῖν). And I have a mind to give (δοῦναι, acc.) this to you. And I have found! no one more faithful nor careful than you. You therefore alone are worthy of so great a gift. To-morrow then you shall see (ὄψει, acc.) in the midst? of this room all my gold lying on the ground.'

And after this the Spirit went away; and after a little interval it was day: and instead of the Spirit the gold was upon the earth.

And the Spirit was away (use ἄπ-ειμι, like εἰμι) fifty years! in Asia: and at last he had (εἰμί) permission to return to his former city. And immediately he went to the house of the miserly man. And thus he talked (διελέγετο) to himself : 'About the man? himself nothing is certain to me: for after fifty years' interval he is perhaps dead (τέθνηκε) : but about the gold already everything is plain: for it? at least will be in safety.'

And this was true. For there was a large strong' chest, and within this was the gold, and on the top lay (ἔκειτο) the man. And in his hand were the keys of the chest. And he was a corpse. For he had died> from want of food in (the midst of) so much wealth. And the Spirit found in the chest not only the former gold, but also double as much, gathered by the dead (aorist particip.) man laboriously during this time.

And Aeacus said this: 'Where have you come (aorist) from? and who and what kind of man are you?'

And he said: 'I am a Persian, Ariphernes by name: and I had a terrible disease for? many years: and I was not capable myself of attending to (ἐπιμελεῖσθαι, gen.) my province, and the common people there :? but all such things I intrusted to assistants and slaves.

But Aeacus with much laughter answered thus: ' But, my friend, this (fellow) is a fool. And many mischiefs arise for mankind on account of the fools, but this man was better than other fools precisely? on account of his laziness: for thus less mischiefs arose to the multitude.'

To-day I was in the law-court, and was listening to the judge there: and this is clear to me about him: Aeacus will send him to Elysium.

And one tree they nourish, and name it Mother: from out of this the first man came forth. And after this a second tree sent forth all the animals. But the man bore the darkness ill, and kindled a fire. And most of the animals fled away in? great fear, but the sheep and. the ox and the dog remained. So these from that time are friendly to man.

The Perfect é-Avx-a makes λελυκ-ώς, -via, -ds, -ότος, -vias, -ὅτος, etc.

The Augment is always dropped in the Participle, the reduplication retained.

Obs.---In the Vocabularies henceforth a. and f. are used with Verbs to mean Aorist and Future. Thus :---

λείπω (f. λείψω, a. -λιπ-) means that the Future of λείπω is λείψω, and the Aorist Indic. is ἔ-λιπ-ον.

Writing? appears to barbarians to be a very wonderful and divine (thing).

There once was a certain master who had an Egyptian slave. And he sent him to a friend, bearing a bag in which he had hidden® ten most beautiful and sweet apples. And with the apples he put a letter into the bag, in which he wrote the number of the apples, that there were (say ' are') ten. And this he did from suspicion about' the slave: for the Egyptians are for the most part faithless. And when the sun became (ἐγένετο) hot, and the slave was thirsty (had thirst), at last having taken out two of the apples, he ate them up. But having again hidden the rest in the bag, he came to the friend of his master and gave all to him.

Accordingly, growing angry, he abused the slave, and said as follows: 'You are false and untrustworthy, fellow, since (say ' who,' ὅστις) having received ten apples you have only given back' eight. Why have you stolen? the two?' But to him it seemed to be useless and foolish to make a false excuse: 'for the letter,' he said to himself, 'saw me eating, and told everything, I suppose.' So he confessed everything, and weeping much, asked him to grant (say 'have') pardon. And he pardoned him: and he went away.

And again the master sent the slave to the same friend, bidding him carry the bag as before, having twenty apples in a letter. And everything occurred (ἐγένετο) as before. For, distressed with the heat of the sun, and having terrible thirst, he wished to eat the apples. But fearing the letter, as knowing how-many apples there were (are), first he hid it under a great stone, and having retired far from thence, he again took out two apples and ate them up. And having done this, he went back again to the stone, and having taken up the letter, put it into the bag, being pleased with his skill, and saying, 'O most hateful writing, now indeed I have! splendidly deceived you, having before told (agrees with 'you ) everything against me.'

But he, wondering much how? the letter saw what he did, lying far away under a stone, and fearing excessively, told everything to his friend, saying as follows : ' But never again shall I be faithless, most excellent (sir), for now I discover that I am never able to deceive (acc.) these accursed writings, which always saw and noticed everything.' And for the rest of the time he never stole anything more.

And in the same land there is a race of apes, being both otherwise intelligent, and especially clever at finding! water. And this they find, as is natural, by the smell, being a long way off. Accordingly the barbarians, having caught one of the apes, and having tied his leg with a thong, lead him through the land. And the ape follows willingly for a time? : but, suddenly getting scent as though from the water, then he no longer is willing to go with those who are leading him,' but wishes to pursue the smell. And thenceforward he? leads, tied with a thong, and they follow.

And he led him, with his feet tied (say 'tied as to (acc.) his feet') with a thong, as we said before. And the ape having a most dreadful thirst, was very eager about (use ert) finding? the water, and many springs he found by smelling, keeping his nose close to the earth, like a dog tracking stags. And the Ethiopian, thus finding a spring, drank himself, but did not even allow (εἴα) the faithful ape to approach.

There was once a thief by name Thepos, who stealing many things by all manner of arts became very famous. For this man, once coming into the market, wished to buy a certain very precious stone, and taking the stone he said to the dealer as follows : 'Sir, I am a stranger, and have come from far: and on this account I have not yet money, such as is current here. Are you willing therefore in place of money to take these ducats?' And at the same time, while-saying! this he showed him a bag full of golden ducats. And the dealer being experienced in such things, took out one of the ducats, and testing it with a touchstone, discovered it to be (being) in truth golden.

Now in this city the archers are the guards of the market, searching out everything, and tracking the thieves. He therefore came! and asked the dealer as follows: 'Sir, was there here? just now a stranger, buying precious stones and giving in exchange ducats apparently of gold?'$ And the dealer, as was natural, fearing for his jewel, and suspecting Thepos to be a thief,' told everything to the archer and showed him the ducats.

For the ducats which you supposed to be golden, having rubbed them with the touchstone, I have! often seen already : and they? are not golden at all, but false, made out of copper: but there is gold on the top (say ' lies on them'), so that the touchstone is of course useless with respect to such (coins). But give me the sham gold, which shall give me evidence against the thief.' And taking the ten ducats he went off quickly, as though after Thepos. But the dealer remained many days,? hoping to see the archer coming back with the jewel and the thief.

And in consequence of this there were party quarrels: and the majority were well-disposed to the tagoi, but the nobles being few were? hostile, and would' not obey. And the tagoi perceiving this grew angry, and employed violence, so that they were no longer able to resist.

And, a tagos going out for purpose of hunting, and seeing an elephant, thought it was (to be) a rock.4 And, a tagos, riding on the road, fell into a well; and not knowing® how to swim was drowned (say ' disappeared').

And Thepos went away and came to a famous physician, by name Goulos. And he said as follows: 'Goulos, I have a brother in other respects quite well as regards health, but in? one matter diseased and mad. For he is always talking about ten talents, and everywhere giving trouble, and asking everybody as though they owed \[owing\] this to him.

And everywhere when he came (partic.) into an inn he asked the hostess this, and finding the jugged hare and eating it he was much pleased. And once he arrived at Athens, and searching for an inn, he saw several people going into the Town Hall: and it seemed to him to be a very large inn. So he went in himself also, and finding? a slave by the door he went up to him and spoke to him in a loud voice\* as follows: 'Can you give me jugged hare?' And all who were present laughed at him, and he was abashed and defeated.

And a scholar once upon a time was an example of this, for he read many books, but for daily life? was evidently' very absurd.

For once seeing in summer-time® a river, and wishing to bathe, he jumped down into the water. But not knowing to swim at all, and being frightened, and rolling about in the water like a porpoise, at last he was nearly drowned. Buta farmer passing by saved him, pulling him out with a rope, und when he was safe (partic.) he said as follows: 'To-day I will keep away from the water : and to-morrow, having learnt the art of swimming' at home, I will again make trial of the river.'

Another time the scholar keeping a horse, grew vexed on account of the expensiveness, and said to his slave, 'You must not give so much fodder to the horse; for he ought to be kept at a less expense.' And the horse, not having enough to eat, after having been! ill for some time, died. But the scholar was very much grieved, lamenting and complaining, for he said as follows, 'How unlucky I am! and all this trouble I have had? in vain. For this horse, having learnt to eat nothing,' and having become cheap and useful to me, has foolishly died, and all this trouble must begin again from the beginning.' And buying another horse, he again treated him in (acc.) the same manner, so that this also he lost likewise by hunger, being indeed unlucky.

But he turned round, as being in pain, but none the more gave him any' answer. 'Well!' said the scholar, 'may I myself some day be ill, and treat you so when you come to me!'

When Conos was once king of the Indians, the officer died who used! to kill those condemned to death.? And, wishing to choose another, Conos called an assembly, and ordered those who wished to have the office of the officer to be present. And there were present three, prepared® as for the contest, so that they brought out three of the condemned, whom it was necessary to kill, by way of trial. And the first of the competitors cut off the head of the man with one blow. And the second not only cut it off with one blow, but, cutting very skilfully, did not even throw it down from his shoulders. And the third shook his sword for a little, but stopped, not even seeming to have touched' the prisoner. And Conos asking, 'When then will you kill him?' he ordered them to put salt to the nose of the man, and, a sneeze occurring, the head fell off. The king therefore, much. pleased, chose this

man.

And he, being easy-tempered, did not care at all nor rebuke them. And a certain woman of the place,! having been disgracefully insulted, wished to go to the king and get? assistance, and punish the man who had insulted her. But her father advised her as follows. 'Ask nothing,' said he, 'from him at least, for he who does not assist himself when insulted, how shall such a one assist another?' But, nevertheless, she went and said? as follows: 'King! I do not ask for any aid, but I wish to learn from you how, being insulted, I shall bear it with such indifference.'

'For often,' he said, 'a man succeeds by such means, when other people are unsuccessful.' And for a long time Pompos proved a good servant: but one day a friend happened to be coming in to Phaleros, and he saw Pompos running away through a back door having a golden cup. And being captured and brought to his master, he said, 'But I was taking it to the river that I might? wash it!'

And she hearing it,? and being indignant, wanted to prove that (ὅτι) she was (is) royal. And royal persons are easy to discern in this way, because they must lie softly: otherwise they are severely wounded and suffer pain in their body. Accordingly she bought a dry bean and laid it down on a couch, and having spread twenty very soft rugs over the bean, she lay down.

Accordingly being twice cheated he departed and troubled the Kilios no more.

And the boy, having arrived at the city, and having met another young man who had been® an acquaintance (of his) previously, asked him to advise him what he ought' to do, and in what way to live. And he gave him much strange advice \[advised many strange things\], and in return for many gifts he taught him very cleverly to borrow money. Accordingly, when the year was ending, and his father asked him if the money proved sufficient which he had received at his departure, he said, 'Certainly it proved sufficient: for it was on account of this I was able to borrow the rest.'
